To herself, Diona tries nothing less than her hardest to ruin that hateful grog.\nBut no matter the drink, it will turn out to be an unimaginably sumptuous brew so long as it passes through her hands.\nThis is a \"blessing\" she has received, though that blessing is a huge headache for her.\nFor this mixologist proclaims herself to be the \"Wine Industry Slayer,\" and her final objective is the utter destruction of Mondstadt's entire wine industry."

Here, drink this Sea-Salt Lizard, and kiss your life as an alcoholic goodbye...\"\nSo she would say, thus ruining these boozehounds' appetites.\nAnd yet...\n\"*glug*... *glug*... Wow, I have never had such a wonderful drink! Can I get a refill, miss?\"\n\"...You want a refill!?\"\nTo this day, Diona has struggled with her unbroken record of mixing fine drinks. Unable to accept defeat, she has yet to give up on her dream of producing something truly disgusting.\nHowever, the results are always the same, and the Cat's Tail remains a popular watering hole, with its pleased patrons singing praises unending of her skill.\nAll poor Diona can do is puff up her cheeks, tears forming in her eyes as she grumbles:\n\"Just you all wait!\""

It bewitches people and makes them stupid!\"\nThis is the source of Diona's hatred for alcohol, and the beginning of Cat's Tail's turn in fortunes.\nThat said, Margaret, the owner of Cat's Tail, had never expected any of this to happen at all. Rather, she had a much simpler reason for hiring Diona.\n\"What choice did I have? She's just too cute.\""

Diona required no teacher for such skills.\n\"Ah, yes, and she also has a pair of eyes that can see well in the dark.\"\n\"As for weaknesses...

The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.\nMany people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.\nNowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.\nOnly little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.\nThese were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful — feelings worth answering.\nThat was what the spring fairy believed.\nSo, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.\nOn the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.\n\"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\"\nFrom that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.\nTill today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream."

He simply brought a new one back the very next day.\nWhen Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.\nEver skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.\n\"Now, this suits you far better,\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod."

It'll numb the pain a little...\"\nThat was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion.\n\"Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! Hahaha—Ouch...\"\nGetting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.\nStill, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all."
