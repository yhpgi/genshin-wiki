Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: \"For Mondstadt, as always.\"\nSome time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say \"For Mondstadt, as always\" before learning to say \"Mommy.\"\nAs a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, \"Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection,\" and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.\nNow, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.\n\"You have to give your all to do the right thing.

Jean gladly lends a hand whenever she can.\n\"The chance to help someone in need is reason enough for a knight.\"\nTo her, her knightly duty takes priority over her role as Acting Grand Master. She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.\nShe holds her fellow knights to the same standard.\nLisa the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and \"enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady.\"\nHowever, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady.\n\"Jean is so reliable.\"\nSuch is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.\nHer only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day.

Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.\nHer passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.\nOne is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.\nThe other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.\nThe effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great.\n\"Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.\"\n\"Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\"...\"\nHe is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.\nJean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.\nHalf a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.\nAn expedition — how typical of Varka's character.\n\"I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.\"\n\"Leave it to me, Grand Master.\"\nAfter seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:\nUpon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt."

Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.\nOn the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.\nThe title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?\nMore than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?\nBeneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.\nThe wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:\nFor Mondstadt, as always.\nTo become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.\nTo this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.\nThe great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.\nSo too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's."

When he came to Mondstadt, he dusted off his past self and started anew with the Church of Favonius, and ascended to high office within it, becoming known as the Cardinal of Daybreak.\nThe two lovers eventually parted ways. Young Jean, holding her mother's hand, would watch the silhouettes of her father and her sister, Barbara, grow ever more distant.\nLater, Barbara would follow in her father's footsteps and join the Church of Favonius, becoming a deaconess much beloved by the people.\nJean has always wanted to get closer to her younger sister by blood, but cannot bring herself to say anything when faced with Barbara's evasive eyes.\nPerhaps this all-too-similar awkwardness is a sign that the sentiment is shared.\nMaster Jean has yet another secret.\nNo matter how many times she has read the historical classics, despite her title of Dandelion Knight, and though she has become the Acting Grand Master whom everyone relies on...\nJean still loves romance novels.\nThis is not for the years as a young girl that she missed amid her training and duties, or due to the rift that formed in her parents' marriage.\nJean simply yearns for the mutual attraction spoken of in such stories, for those emotions as subtle and fragile as spider-silk.\nAs a knight, she must put Mondstadt and the Knights of Favonius first.\nBut...\n\"If I too could...\"\nIn her office, deep at night, Jean once again finishes reading \"Vera's Melancholy.\"\n\"If I have the time, it should be fine to go to Cape Oath, just before daybreak... right?\"\nLowering her head, Jean peeks out her window at the glittering stars above."

From without, the Fatui exerted diplomatic pressure, and from within, there were traitors — comrades of the former Inspector. Regrouping and finding a way to break through was no easy task.\nBut Jean was able to fend off the external pressure with one hand, and lead the Knights to smash the many plots of the Abyss Order with the other, re-establishing the authority of the Knights of Favonius.\nJean will never forget the moment she received her Vision. At that moment, all seemed to grow quiet as she felt the breeze flow through her hand. The world seemed to fade away, save for the time-honored motto of the house of Gunnhildr:\n\"For Mondstadt, as always.\""

The perfect choice for a trip to the seaside.\nThe Acting Grand Master's life runs like the gears of a machine, driven by the great force of heavy responsibility, constantly being ground down by work.\nOver time, the armor of chivalry has become like Jean's second skin, the presentation of proper dress code and a formal image becoming ever more firmly forged into her nature.\nBut in truth, Jean is no older than the ordinary young women around her.\nIn the novels that these young ladies enjoy, gorgeous gowns are as quintessential as the sun, moon, and starlight themselves, and some opulent noble scions do indeed sit pretty in dresses that sprawl out like palaces, their hem-lines and long skirts intertwined like the lapping waves of the sea.\nPerhaps Jean once had such romantic aspirations too. After all, who has never hankered after the blissful beauty of luxury?\nBut now, Jean has had her wish granted with a set of form-fitting summer wear made just for her- and this one item has far surpassed any number of beauteous dresses that appeared in her novels.\n\"I heard that the original idea was Barbara's and that she and Lisa searched every store before deciding on the most suitable design.\"\n\"Then Kayea was somehow able to convince Master Diluc to hire craftsmen to make some modifications...\"\n\"... With fabric chosen by Amber out of her experience with making Baron Bunnies, to render it comfortable but relatively inexpensive...\"\n\"... And with gems for decoration picked from Albedo and Klee's collections.\"\n\"The tailoring was then overseen by Noelle, right down to the last needle and thread...\"\n\"... And the detailed dimensions were provided by Lisa, who even sewed this lovely rose ornament on personally...\"\nThis gift, made for her by everyone, was the loveliest surprise she had ever had.\nIf her previous holiday was a tiny respite amidst a sea of work, this seaside trip was an unexpected opportunity to fully relax.\nHaving laid her armor aside, she now shimmered in the sea's light like a twirling dandelion.\n\"This... is the first time I've ever had such a relaxing summer holiday.\""

I found them while sorting things out in the room...\"\nThe folded ceremonial clothes in Barbara's hands had the Knights' crest on it, which shone with a golden light as it caught the sun's rays.\nIt looked familiar, true, but Jean was very sure that she had never owned such a set of clothes before.\nCome to think of it, the uniform she usually wore was hand-sewn by her mother.\n\"Wait... could that be yours, Mother?\"\nFrederica smiled as her daughter asked this question- a rare sight to see on her face.\n\"Ah, it's been so long. So, Seamus still kept it, huh?\"\n\"These were the clothes I wore when they granted me the title of 'Alder Knight.' You can take them, if you don't mind.\"\nThe seedlings of yesteryear have grown strong, and with their shade they shelter the land they know so well.\nThe glories of the past have been passed on, and they shine even brighter for it.\nThey saluted each other first as knights would- and then immediately embraced as only family long-overdue for a reunion might."
