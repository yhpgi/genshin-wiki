It has the ability to transform into other objects, including humans.</p><p>Although they often tangle with a mysterious organization under the Shogunate, the tanuki are not a wicked lot and only tease humans for fun.</p><p>There is but one recorded exception: years ago, the bake-danuki who guarded Chinju Forest started a battle due to some conflict between their leader Ioroi and a kitsune. In the end, most of the bake-danuki were sealed within stone statues.</p>",
