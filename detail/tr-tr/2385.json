However, few people know that this rather silly exterior hides a killer technique — this fish is capable of sucking water into its body before expelling it like a cannon from its mouth with such force and pinpoint accuracy that even fishermen might be stunned by it. Truly, it is a first-rate killer in the water.<br/>\"Pufferfish ahead? Watch for spittle!\" — Angler's Atlas, Pufferfish Chapter",
