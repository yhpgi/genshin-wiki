Since fate is destined for cyclicality, she must fulfill her promise and declare war on \"her.\"<br/><br/><i>Mine is the most supreme and noble form. Power over the realm has been vested within me, and I am the essence of all that is the \"Raiden Shogun.\"</i><br/><i>\"Naturally, I have also inherited the pain of Ei's countless losses and her will to attain Eternity.</i><br/><i>\"Resolve, valor, love, hate... They will all twist in the river of time.</i><br/><i>\"But the 'rules' will never change.\"</i>",
