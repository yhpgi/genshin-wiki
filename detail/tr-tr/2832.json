  "desc": "<p>A medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilages that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm it. </p><p>Specimens with a greenish tint are the common species in this lineage. They look like an unripe fruit on a tree branch, hence the nickname \"True Fruit.\" </p><p>However, there are very few bones in this fish. The meat is fatty and rich, but if it's not handled properly, or you remove its gallbladder too late, the fish's meat will be as sour as unripe fruit. Therefore, \"making this fish delicious\" has become the standard by which all chefs are measured.</p>",
