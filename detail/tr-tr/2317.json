            "text": "Stories about memories are always closely intertwined with transience. This book is not all-new, but is an adaptation of \"Urakusai's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune.\"\nPrologue\nStories relating to memory always seem to have to do with those moments where you gain something and lose it straight away.\nIf you're wondering how I came to write about it, it's hardly the most exciting story.\nThat night, I was drinking and killing time at the Uyuu Restaurant when I happened to run into an old friend that I hadn't seen in forever. I don't know when she arrived, but at some point I suddenly noticed her sitting there in one of the booths.\n\"My, my, now, who could this be, sitting there in such a good mood, yet drinking all alone?\"\nSince she was asking, I thought I might as well mutter something in response:\n\"The best liquor comes at the highest price, and sometimes that price is waiting alone.\"\n\"Pff, I've definitely heard that one before... Still as boring as ever, I see.\"\nThus remarked the chief editor as she stood there with a liquor cup in hand, looking very enthusiastic about the prospect of having a drink or two.\n\"Why not earn yourself some drinking money? It's not like you've got anything better to do.\"\n\"Tonight, though, the drinks are on me.\"\nShe laughed, and reiterated this a couple more times.\n\"You're back.\"\nI watched as the evening breeze brought a few flower petals from the Sacred Sakura and landed them in her cup, making ripples that disturbed the reflection of the moon.\nOvercome by a strong sense of déjà vu, my mouth took it upon itself to proceed with an utterance that would prove to be something of an embarrassment to my brain.\n\"You're drunk.\"\nShe didn't look very happy to hear that, and retorted with a firm and defiant tone in her voice.\nBut her countenance quickly changed again as she placed her cup down on the table and let out a sigh:\n\"I wasn't even born yet when she left.\"\nAnd I was still in my youth back then.\n\"You must be the only one still able to recite the stories she once told.\"\nAnd just like that, I found myself roped into writing for the Yae Publishing House one more time. It's quite amusing, now I think about it.\nTo my faithful readers, please don't be upset. This should not be taken to mean that I am committed to no longer writing save for when it becomes a selfish indulgence.\nAfter all, there's some great liquor that's soon to decrease in price, and I have to make sure I'm prepared. Besides, I have to pay the chief editor back for the wine she so kindly bought me that night."

            "text": "The story of the \"Black Fox\" Itaru was actually the third volume in the original \"Urakusai's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune.\" It appears at the front of this edition due to the writer's personal preference.\nForgive my garrulousness, but there are still some things to get out of the way before the story begins in earnest.\nWhy the \"new\" chronicles of the six kitsune?\nNaturally, the word \"new\" here presumes the existence of an \"old.\" This book is a slightly revised edition of Urakusai's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune, which enjoyed a period of great popularity five hundred years ago. I possess but limited writing skills, and can only hope that Urakusai and my other readers will peruse these pages with forgiving eyes.\nUrakusai was already famous when I was but a small child. By that time, the Saiguu had already taken great interest in Urakusai's literary abilities and expertise on tea, making Urakusai one of the most cultured and sophisticated of all the kitsune.\nUnfortunately, that is all in the past now. Urakusai made a grave mistake and had to leave. It has now been 500 years since then...\nWithout further ado, the story of the New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune begins on the towering Mt. Yougou.\nLegend has it that in the time of the Great Kitsune Hakushin, she had six apprentices. All were greatly skilled in magic and in shape-shifting. Day-to-day, they were tasked with assisting their matriarch, Hakushin, in managing the shrine and defending Mt. Yougou.\nThe eldest of the six was Itaru the Black Fox, who, unlike most other females, was built as broad as a bear and as strong as a tiger. She also had a wild and unruly personality. One day, she was being drunk and disorderly in the main hall of the shrine, and destroyed a shintai that represented the Shogun. Incensed, Hakushin banished Itaru from the mountain for a period of much-needed self-reflection.\nBut Black Fox Itaru was all too happy to leave the mountain behind. She put Hakushin's warnings completely out of her mind, found a bottle of good-quality liquor, and headed straight for the nearest village to look for trouble."

            "text": "This volume recounts the clash between \"Black Fox Itaru\" and the \"Twin Oni of Tokaku.\" This tale was missing from the original text, but it was fortunately rediscovered at a later date. It is presented here in an edited form.\nContinuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru was on her way to the village looking for trouble when she saw two women standing at the side of the road dressed like lumberjacks. Both had three blades hanging from their waist: a seven-foot-long nodachi, a kodachi, and a wakizashi. They were armed to the teeth, and they weren't hiding it.\nAs her big, bulky silhouette approached from a distance, the ground shook and dust went flying with each step she took — all of which put the two women on high alert. They grasped the hilts of their blades, ready to draw them at any moment, and asked in unison:\n\"Who are you? Are you a youkai!?\"\nThe silhouette answered:\n\"Haha, that's exactly what I am!\"\nWithout hesitation, the two women immediately drew their swords and stepped forward, intending to slay Itaru. But this was one youkai they had underestimated. She dodged their attacks in a single step, grabbed their wrists, and twisted them as she turned sideways, sending both of their seven-foot-long nodachi clattering to the ground. Alarmed by the pain, the two reached for their kodachi, but they were too late. Itaru sent one of them flying to the ground with an almighty slap, while placing the other into a headlock. Then, she grabbed the one under her arm by the scruff of the neck and lifted her up into the air, placing her foot on the other's chest to pin her to the ground.\n\"The Twin Oni of Tokaku? Looks like neither of you have learned anything from the beating I gave you last year for harassing the villagers!\"\nWhen the two bandits heard this, they panicked and started begging for their lives. Black Fox Itaru threw them to the ground and begin to speak:\n\"Fair enough. Well, I'm a masterless youkai now that I've been banished from the mountain by Hakushin. Why don't the two of you join me? We'll go around helping those in need. It'll be fun!\""

But at this time, the mother-daughter pair are still reliant on Itaru to rescue them.\nContinuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru successfully tamed the bandit duo, the Twin Oni of Tokaku, and the three set off on their new journey of chivalry.\nAs the chivalric trio was resting in Konda Village, they ran into a mother and her daughter.\nAfter striking up a conversation, they learned that the mother's surname was Youzan, the daughter's given name was Yui, and that both were musicians from the distant Seirai Island visiting Inazuma City to join in the festival. On their way, they had been scammed by a Lavender Melon seller from the village: He had offered them a few melons to quench their thirst, ostensibly out of the goodness of his heart, before then insisting that they purchase more of his melons at an extortionate price. But touring musicians aren't exactly wealthy, and they couldn't afford to spend the entirety of their budget for the return trip on overpriced melons...\nThe Twin Oni of Tokaku are an impulsive pair. Upon hearing the story, they instantly began fuming with rage, and unanimously decided that they needed to teach this dishonest merchant a lesson by cutting him into tiny pieces. But Black Fox Itaru had another idea, and spoke up to stop the two sisters:\n\"Enough. I know what to do.\"\nShe comforted the mother and daughter:\n\"You two have nothing to worry about. Just watch, I'll talk to the merchant, and he'll come to his senses.\"\nItaru marched off to look for the dishonest merchant."

            "text": "This is the tensest tale of the series, said to have been written by Urakusai upon his return from Liyue. It is featured in full in this writer's adaptation.\nWe shall bring the anecdotes of Black Fox Itaru to a close for now. Please forgive me for nagging, but I have some old matters I wish to comment on.\nNow, it is no longer well-known how exactly Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu at that time. However, Lady Yae did offer to tell me some snippets of the history she experienced after having between two and eight drinks.\nThis is a novel, of course, so I naturally would like to turn these words into a story of what history has not recorded.\nWhen the Kitsune Saiguu departed from the Hakushin Lands to take up her post at the Grand Narukami Shrine, Lady Yae still had yet to be born. As such, her early years were filled with stories and tales about Saiguu, and she loved and respected her greatly.\nThis is also why Lady Yae would eventually come to the Grand Narukami Shrine herself after embarking on her own travels.\nDue to their closeness by blood, Lady Saiguu doted upon Lady Yae quite a bit, though Lady Yae speaks as little as possible about those times as she may nowadays...\n—And while I as a novelist write to entertain, I shall refrain from revealing too much about Lady Yae's past, lest I suffer under the editor-in-chief's mighty pen.\nBut back to Urakusai. It is no longer clear how Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu back in the day, but it is known that his deeds may have had some connection to the later incursion of the Abyss.\nHowever, after Urakusai had been driven out, the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer dwell at the Grand Narukami Shrine, but would instead set up permanent residence at Tenshukaku.\n\"A disaster that will engulf heaven and earth is coming. My duty is to defend the people and protect our lord, and so I must go to the Shogun's side.\"\nWhen Lady Saiguu departed the second time, Lady Yae was but a young girl. The person she had pursued all this time now left her again. It was not until the untimely disaster swept across the archipelago that we understood the meaning of Lady Saiguu's words...\nBut it was too late, and things had not turned out as we would have wished.\nThis time, Lady Saiguu left a third time. This time, she departed forever.\nFive centuries may seem long to mortals, but the joys and sorrows left by the things that happened during that time, whether to fleeting existences or enduring ones, are not easy to erase."
