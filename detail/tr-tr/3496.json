There may yet be some small, guiding power within them...\nWhen touched by someone who has been chosen by the oases, these buds will guide them to a certain spot. There, one may summon the memories of the past and, through them, change the situation in the present. Gain the guidance of the Goddess of Flowers via this means to find the lost inscriptions that once marked the three thrones."
