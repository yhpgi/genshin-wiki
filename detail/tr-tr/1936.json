Torachiyo was a highly skilled warrior, such that it was once said the Torachiyo might dance amid a thousand blades, juunihitoe robes becoming shredded like falling violet petals, and yet not receive a single wound. Yet this oni would eventually betray the Shogun and revolt, becoming shorn of an arm and a horn in the battle before fleeing and slaying itself in a fit of furious madness.<br/>Hearsay holds that the stubborn oni often hold fear and distress in their hearts. That they should fantasize about eternity yet fear the moment, and are apt to become swallowed by terror or anger is their just reward. This mask depicts Torachiyo, fangs bared.",

At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.<br/>This is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changed over many years to \"Torachiyo.\"<br/>But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.<br/>Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional.",
