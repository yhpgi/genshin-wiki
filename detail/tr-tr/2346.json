The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, an 11-part story, begins here.\n\"Dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land.\"\nThe little fox chanted.\nHe blew the dandelion flower and sent the seeds flying. He then spoke in a more serious tone.\n\"May my teacher's wishes ride the wind and reach the Anemo Archon.\"\nA wind blew past us and swept away the dandelion seeds.\nDid they fly to a better place, carrying my hopes and dreams there with them?\nWhen did this happen?\nSome time ago, behind the village, there grew a forest of countless lush trees. At the center of this forest was a small lake.\nThe lake was like the stained glass windows of Mondstadt Cathedral: crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight.\nThe sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of gemstone. It was really something.\nThe weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the lake's edge. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago.\nI couldn't remember much about her, but felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within.\nI became lost in thought as I stared at the glistening water. Walking transfixed along the lakeside, I had forgotten entirely that I was out for a hunt.\nI came to when I heard the sound of something freezing up. It was a Mist Flower growing by the lake, having just frozen the water around it. Next to it was a white fox, its tail frozen in the ice. Poor critter.\n\"It must have had its tail in the water by the Mist Flower while it was drinking.\"\nMist Flowers are dangerous plants and can cause frostbite if handled without care. Extreme caution must be taken when handling them.\nAs it saw me approach, the fox struggled in fear, but its still-frozen tail kept it rooted to the spot. The fox whimpered in pain.\n\"Oh no, this won't do.\"\nI thought to myself.\n\"Poor critter. It's gonna die anyway if I don't save it, may as well end its pain by bringing it home as my game for the day.\"\nI imagined what a delicious fox stew I could cook with the carrots I grew. Just thinking about it gave me energy and brought a smile to my face.\nSo I took out my hunting bow and slowly walked toward it.\n\"Be good and stay put.\""

When I went fox hunting, I always chanted his words silently, so that my hands wouldn't shake when pulling the bowstring.\nBut just as I was about to release the arrow, the fox lifted its head and looked me straight in the eye. It had eyes like the lake, glistening as if harboring fragments of gemstone within.\nMy head began spinning, as if a strong wind were blowing inside it. My arrow missed its target and instead smashed the ice, releasing the fox's tail. The fox raised its tail and looked at me once more before running off into the forest.\nI came to my senses and began the chase — but who in this world can run faster than a fox?\nGradually, the fox began to shrink into the distance, eventually turning into a white spot.\n\"Hey! Don't go!\"\nI shouted, barely catching my breath.\nAfter hearing my words, the spot seemed to slow.\n\"Is it waiting for me?\"\nI pondered.\n\"If running for its life, a fox is able to shake off anyone in no time.\"\nFoxes are strange animals. Even when running on a flat plain like at Windrise, where one can see clearly for miles ahead, they somehow still seem to disappear from view.\nIt's almost as if they run into another world.\nThis led me to my conclusion:\n\"The fox must be waiting for me!\"\nConvinced of this fact, I chased the glittering white spot for hours on end. Suddenly, a chilling wind began to blow.\nI stood there, shivering, and what I saw next astounded me.\n\"How can this be?\"\nSuddenly, instead of one, there were now two white spots.\nMore appeared. Three, four, five... They seemed to grow in number as the winds blew. Eventually I lost track.\nSuddenly, with a stinging sensation, one of them flew directly into my eye. Upon inspection, I discovered that the spots were in fact nothing more than dandelion seeds floating in the wind. The fox had disappeared.\nI laughed at my own foolishness and went home.\nFor supper, I had carrot fox stew — though without fox, or any other meat for that matter. The gods know how much I hate boiled carrots without meat! I felt starving, and in time fell asleep.\nI awoke in the middle of the night to something stirring outside my door."

The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, Part 3.\nHaving failed to catch the fox, I went to sleep with only tasteless boiled carrots in my stomach. If not for what happened next, I would have forgotten about the fox by now.\nI awoke with a start to strange noises coming from outside my door.\n\"Perhaps boars have come to eat my carrots?\"\nI hopped out of bed and opened my door. To my surprise, there stood a tiny little white fox. Its fur was so white that it glowed in the dark, not unlike the way sunlight sparkles on water after filtering through the treetops.\n\"This must be the same fox from earlier!\"\nI thought again of those eyes that looked like gemstones in the water, gazing at me as if from the depths of my heart.\nAnd so I walked over to the fox, unarmed and with tired eyes.\nThis time it stayed still and waited for me in silence.\nThe closer I drew, the greater in stature it became.\nBy the time I stood before it, it had magically transformed into a human.\nShe was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water — in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops.\n\"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\"\nI thought to myself.\n\"This can't be. Must be some type of fox magic.\"\nStranger still, the idea of \"fox magic\" had only occurred to me in that instant. You'd believe anything after you'd seen those eyes.\nFor all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the dead of night.\nAnd at last she spoke. Though not in our common tongue, I could somehow understand her. Some other magic, perhaps.\n\"I would have died by that lake, if you had not come in my hour of need.\"\nShe paused and continued:\n\"Although to die by that gemstone lake is no bad thing,\"\n\"We foxes are grateful beings, so you must let me return the favor.\"\nShe bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams."

Whatever the case, the following days brought real stew to the table.\nBut the fox never came again.\nAs strange as it may seem, it had honestly been easier to sleep hungry. Even with a full, satisfied stomach, I couldn't help but think about the day we met, and the woman that the fox had turned into...\nWhen would I gaze upon her eyes again, glittering... like water in a lake.\nLying half-asleep with a heart full of turmoil, I heard a faint sound outside my door.\nI hopped from the bed and swung the door open, eager to see a small white silhouette awaiting me.\nBut there were no lake-blue eyes, and there was no fluffy white foxtail. Instead, all I could see were dandelion seeds drifting in the white moonlight, floating like snowflakes in the air.\nSuddenly, something got caught in my nostrils.\n\"Ah-Ahchooo!!!\"\nImmediately, the fluffy white dandelion seeds began to swirl, filling the sky like a snowstorm.\nAmidst the flurry of dandelion seeds, a pair of jewel-like eyes were looking at me, staring straight into my heart.\nWaving away the swirling dandelion seeds, I started walking towards the small fox.\nThe fox raised its ears and its furry tail flitted across the grass as it turned and disappeared into the depths of the forest.\nI hurried and followed closely behind.\nIn amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be seen weaving between the shadows.\nTheir silhouettes tip-toed like moonlight cast among the tree leaves, or like the hesitant strides of a crafty Seelie.\nWith unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the dark forest in a seemingly faraway land.\nThere, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far as my eyes could see.\nStunned by the sight, I began to notice a rustling noise coming from just behind me.\nIt was a light, delicate sound. Like that of a girl walking barefoot across pine needles and leaves on the ground.\nThe fox approached me from behind. The night air ferried her presence, cool and damp, whisked together with the slightly bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers.\nTwo hands with slender, ice-cold fingers rested upon my shoulders.\nShe leaned in close to my ear and her long hair draped down over my shoulder.\nBehind me, I felt the soft rhythm of both her breath and her heartbeat. It made me feel calm and at ease.\n\"Only the foxes know the way to this place. It is the homeland of the dandelions.\nIt is my desire that you would tarry here, and teach my child human language...\nIn return, I will teach you the magic of foxes.\"\nThere was a tickle in my ear, as if one of the dandelion seeds had grazed it on its journey into the warm night air.\nStrange. I had certainly never mentioned anything about magic to her before. How could she have known?\nWithout answering, she took my hand and led me into the depths of the sea of dandelions.\nThe night breezes from both north and south carried the bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers and faded memories...\nIn those fields of velvet white, she showed me how foxes play gently together in their own fashion, until the moon rose high into the starry sky."

Suddenly, I knew the answer to that question that had been lingering on my mind for years.\n\"So all the foxes that disappear during the hunt, this is where they hide away.\"\nI thought to myself.\n\"What a beautiful place.\"\nBut when I began teaching the little fox to speak our common tongue, my heart always felt empty, like a wind was blowing inside of me.\nWhen we talked, I would look into her gemstone-lake eyes. In those moments I felt like I was speaking not to the fox, but to a girl I used to love many years ago.\nAnd so, when she was around me, it was as if I were in the presence of the child of someone I had once loved: We had an enjoyable time together, but the experience was somehow tinged with sadness.\nBut the thought of her promise — if I succeeded in teaching her child to speak the common tongue...\n\"I shall impart the magic of transformation to you when the time comes.\"\nRemembering the way she made that solemn promise to me... I knew she was serious, and that gave me determination.\nCould I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef.\n\"I could even use magic to hunt!\" I couldn't contain my excitement. \"No more meatless carrot stews for me...\"\nI lost track of how long I stayed in the dandelion sea, where everything sways gently with the wind.\nOne reason was that the little one was such a fast learner! I taught him not only our language, but everything I knew in one package, including how to count, how to grow carrots, how to change window panes, and how to sharpen knives.\nWhen it came to rest, we would talk idly.\n\"Why must you learn human speech?\"\nHe answered swiftly:\n\"So that when I transform into a human, I can befriend them!\"\nI continued:\n\"Why would you want to befriend the humans?\"\nHe dropped his gaze."

She seemed rather displeased.\nWe sat amidst the dandelion sea, not saying a word. A long time passed, long enough that I started thinking that she might be angry with me.\n\"We foxes are grateful beings. I will teach you the magic of transformation, and so fulfill your wish.\"\nThe fox said, turning her face towards me.\nHer lake-blue eyes shone in the moonlight, and it made me feel at peace.\nThank goodness, she wasn't mad at me.\nFor some reason I could not clearly name, I quietly heaved a sight of relief."

It catches here and there, and there again it catches a student's tongue, sometimes even tripping a teacher up.\nBut foxes are clever animals, and very quickly they learn the many intricacies of human speech that were handed down over the generations, becoming able to describe the way dandelions float away, or how the moonlight shines over the lake in a rudimentary manner.\nEvery time the little fox discovered a new term, every time he tried using unfamiliar words to explore a familiar world, to bestow meanings upon the wind, dandelions and the earth, she would be beside him, smiling, watching us.\nThe little fox learned very quickly, but I did not take much joy from that.\nWhen I had run out of things to teach, would she still keep me here in this dandelion sea?\nWhen that time came, would I still be able to behold those beautiful eyes under the moonlight?\nWould she still lead me into the depths of the dandelion sea, smiling slyly as we frolicked and breathed in the bitter fragrance that came from both the north and south winds?\nAs I thought about such things, I became lost in sullen memory.\nYes, that's right.
