It tells the story of Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius, in her early years as a slave in Mondstadt.\nFriends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your hearts' content!\nTo freedom! To the Anemo Archon!\nTo Vennessa, the first Knight to grace this world!\nSons and daughters of Mondstadt, may the gift from the Anemo Archon be engraved in your hearts!\nAnd let it be known that this gift is not freedom, but just defiance!\nIt transpired in ages past.\nFriends, do excuse me for improvising,\nFor it should be clear as day, that the glory and freedom of Mondstadt\nWere born when Barbatos struck the strings dolce.\nPoems sing of heroic fame,\nYet to commemorate unnamed freedom should they aim.\nChained by the royals, Mondstadt could barely suspire,\nAnd festivities were but vanity games of the rich,\nBeyond the grasp of the ordinary people.\nA withering dungeon, Mondstadt was.\nIn slavery games the royals gaily relished,\nOblivious to their place, the inmates were.\nA fiery-headed dame confined to a cell,\nFrom the southern plains she did hail.\nBorn free but now bound by chains,\nThough restrained by a tyrant her flesh remained.\nStill her pious soul never ceased to pray,\nFor her people, for Mondstadt, for illusive freedom if she may."

It tells the story of Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius, in her early years when she met Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, as well as how she defeated the drake and overthrew the Aristocrats.\nFriends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your hearts' content!\nThe day came when Barbatos answered her devotion.\nThe Anemo Archon sought her fiery hair and descended to her position.\n\"Every being deserves a name,\" the spirit grinned.\n\"To weave your fair name into a song I yearn,\"\n\"I seek nothing but your friendship in return.\"\nThe girl happily reciprocated, her fears swiftly dissipated.\nAnd so, to the battlefield she marched to Barbatos's singing voice,\nThe demonic dragon fled from her might and the people did rejoice.\nCorpulent aristocrats crawled under tables at such a valiant sight.\n\"Mondstadt is freedom,\" the winds sang for their people in delight.\nLonely forest breezes converged, jointly they overthrew the tyrant's tower from the sky.\nBroken free from shackles at last, the young lioness stood firm in the winds with her head held high.\nAnd so, the fiery-headed dame won herself prestigious fame.\nHer heart swelled with appreciation to sing by the Anemo Archon's side.\nBut no words of gratitude should she utter, Barbatos replied:\n\"You first conducted what now transpires in your song.\"\n\"You have entrusted me with your friendship and your name.\"\n\"To praise your freedom, my songs came.\"\nFriends, let us drink some more!\nFor thence flows the freedom of Mondstadt.\nWhen days become nights and faces fill with despair,\nNever forget the heroic tales of Vennessa, the dame with the flaming hair!\nNever cease to pursue freedom, even when the land is bare!"
