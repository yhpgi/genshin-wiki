They are found mostly where the water is clear and the reeds grow long.<br/>They are the color of a lovely, clear day, and meeting one might mean that you might have a lucky day as well.<br/>They will combine elements that can neither be absorbed nor digested, gravel and ores within their bodies to create sparkling, shining pearls, and will spit them out when threatened to confuse and distract predators.",
