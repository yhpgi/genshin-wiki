He just couldn't figure it out.\nUntil one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.\nThey stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together — she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.\nHer name was Klee.

He was ready to avenge.\nHe threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.\nThe Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions.\n...\nThough he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.\n\"Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them.\"\nWith each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: \"I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all.\"\nBecause the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them."
