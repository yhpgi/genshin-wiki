They discard these tails in moments of peril to confuse their foes.</p><p>Lizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.</p><p>Once they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up.</p>",
