            "text": "The masterpiece of the Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian! Scholar Jacob Musk will show you the mysterious spiritual world of the hilichurls through this poetry collection!\nA collection of hilichurl poetry compiled by the Mondstadt ecologist Jacob Musk. During the writing of this book, Musk traveled across the continent to visit every hilichurl tribe, even going so far as to venture deep into hilichurl settlements and become intimately acquainted with their lives. Musk was praised as the \"Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian\" for this book, but it is evident that neither the scholar himself nor the hilichurls were particularly fond of this honor. Jacob Musk, though enthusiastic about hilichurl studies, loathed to be associated with them even in his late years.\nThe first song:\nMi muhe ye\nMi biat ye\nBiat ye dada\nMuhe dada\nQuite possibly a battle song sung by the hilichurls before combat. I have observed that when two or more hilichurls are present, they engage in frenzied brawling after singing this vulgar song.\nThe second poem:\nEleka mimi-a-Domu\nMita domu-a-dada\nLa-la-la\nLa-la-la\nMimi mosi ye mita\nThe song is sung by hilichurls as they dance around totem poles. In my estimation it is some form of tribal hymn. It has an upbeat tone and is usually heard during festivals.\nThe third poem:\nMi muhe mita nye\nMi muhe mita nye\nMuhe nye\nMuhe nye\nGusha\nBiat, gusha\nA melancholic hilichurl song I heard during an exchange with an elderly samachurl. Although I do not yet understand the literal meaning of the poem, the overwhelming sense of grief that comes through in the song is enough to captivate the best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from the elderly hilichurls were just as melancholic, and just as overwhelming)."

            "text": "Are wine and poetry a part of the hilichurl lifestyle? Do they have pure and devout desires? Expert on the hilichurls, Jacob Musk, is here to answer!\nThe fourth poem:\nCeli upa celi\nSada shato lata\nKuzi unu ya zido\nUnu dada\nA song sung by samachurls. Judging by the reaction of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning for the hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous in mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly exists among the hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study.\nThe fifth song:\nNini movo muhe yoyo\nNini movo mimi tomo\nLata movo mosi yoyo\nCeli movo celi yoyo\nMuch like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of praise to the Anemo Archon. This is a hilichurl ode that is often heard when they are inebriated.\nThe sixth song:\nUnu, unu\nYaya ika kundala!\nUnu, unu\nMita dada ya dala?\nUnu, unu\nKuzi mita dada ye\nMita dada-a-mimi\nA pious ode that is only sung by hilichurls during sacrifices. When performing this ode, the hilichurls often add percussion by beating the backsides of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating rhythmic ringing sounds. It must be quite painful.\nThe seventh song:\nMimi movo\nMimi sada\nMimi domu\nDomu upa\nGusha dada\nIt appears that many hilichurl tribes share a tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song is one such bonfire ballad sung by the chief at the end of the night. At the end of the song, the chief shouts \"nunu\" three times, which presumably carries the meaning of \"sleep.\""
