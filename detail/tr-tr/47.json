And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm...

Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\"\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\nIn the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?\n\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\""
