It's just that interesting things happen in far away galaxies.\nThe great adventure of Vera, an ordinary girl always fascinated by distant lands, secretly begins.\n—Endless Days in Infinite Worlds—\n\"There are times when I think to myself... There's nothing to do in this tiny village. What a dull place to live.\"\nThis wasn't the first time that Vera had complained about her hometown, the small country village of Delphi. Her frown eased slightly as she lay on the hillside near the village, eyes closed, feeling the breeze of the early summer.\n\"Then where in this world would you not consider dull?\" Her buddy Sachi asked curiously.\nVera sat up and leaned forward.\n\"I believe on the other side of the Starry Sea is a planet inhabited by gods who can answer all prayers and wishes, and everyone bearing a wish is on a journey to get there. I believe, in our universe, there is a world currently in a war against doomsday, where the noble and elegant souls of fourteen Valkyries burn bright, if only for a brief but magnificent moment...\"\n\"You've been reading too many of those weird fantasy novels.\"\n\"But... this village really IS dull. When was the last time anything fun happened here?\"\n\"Funny you should say that, a new family did move into our village recently...\"\n\"Novelty and fun aren't the same thing!\"\nDespite what she had said, Vera decided to pay a visit to the newcomers. Sachi, however, remembered his family's rules, and walked back home for dinner.\n...\nVera gave the door to the newcomer's abode a gentle push. Much to her surprise, it wasn't locked.\n\"Anybody home?\"\nNo sooner had the words left her mouth than the living room cupboard doors flew open and out jumped a black-haired boy wearing glasses. He was followed by a tentacled blue slime.\n\"Make way! Tal, why did you let a stranger in?\"\nThe black-haired boy gently pushed Vera out of his way and picked up an axe by the door.\n\"You leave me with no choice. Since you have seen everything, there is only one thing for it...\"\nThus began the biggest crisis of Vera's life."

It's just reaching the age of 14.\nSo begins Vera's adventure.\n—My Backyard is Slightly Bigger than the Entire Universe—\n\"All I can do now is ask you to help me.\" The black-haired boy, who called himself Ike, handed Vera a kitchen knife.\nHe walked back to the cupboard and began slashing at the tentacles frantically.\n\"Come and help me close this door! If a tentacle starts attacking you, use this kitchen knife to defend yourself!\" Ike's glasses were now covered in blue slime. \"Hurry! We can't let this evil demon cross into Delphi.\"\nUpon hearing his words, Vera helped Ike close the door. While they were pushing back the tentacles, Vera accidentally stabbed Ike twice in the back. Thankfully, Ike's healing spells were quite potent.\n\"I shall explain everything to you. I am in fact over a thousand years old, and this door is a gateway to anywhere in the universe. That tentacled monster is an old one from the Large Magellanic Cloud — I went there to get something.\" Ike was covered in slime from head to foot by this point. He wiped his glasses with Vera's dress as he spoke. \"Erm... is there anything else that you'd like to know?\"\n\"Who's Tal?\" Vera didn't seem to mind.\n\"An evil spirit that resided in the man-devouring castle. It has served me as a butler since I subdued it. Strangely, it behaved quite friendly towards you.\"\nVera's parents always reminded her that people are destined to build families, and that it was futile to entertain dreams of anything beyond the homestead. Her buddy Sachi once told her that if a lively girl like her was to marry someone from a faraway land, the whole village would become unbearably lonely.\n(The real reason Sachi said this was that he was something of a weakling, and was sure to be ferociously bullied if he ended up having to play with the boys.)\n\"The human spirit is still too immature. I need to guide you both through the wonders of your childhood.\" Ike extended his inviting arms to Vera. \"You will sing every step of the way on your long journey to youth.\"\nFrom the Orion Arm to the Eternal Jahanam, from the Torrents of Time to the depths of the Starry Sea...\n\"How far is 'beyond'? Any place in this universe is just as boring as my backyard,\" he said.\n\"The scale of everything beyond follows the heart,\" Ike replied. \"Thus, my heart is slightly bigger than the entire universe.\""

You shall call me the Princess Andro-Basilisks.\" The charming girl then crossed her arms, savoring the moment of her entrance in her mind and giggling to herself in amusement.\nHer sole reason for gracing Delphi with her presence was to marry Ike.\n\"If you, he who conquered a quarter of the universe, marry me, my safety shall be guaranteed after my elder sister takes the throne.\"\n\"If I may ask, how big is the Andromeda Empire?\" Vera asked.\n\"I reckon there are more than nine thousand inhabitable planets.\"\n——With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?\n\"So you aren't here to harm Vera?\" Sachi cautiously asked Ike, who was carrying the scrolls and globes of other planets.\n\"Of course not. I think she would make a great assistant.\" After putting everything down, he clapped his hands. \"You like her?\"\n\"Me? No, not at all, I don't like her at all!\" Sachi looked away, worried that the old sage might discern his true feelings.\nHe reached for a box full of photo frames. He grabbed a few at random, each picture depicting a different beauty.\n\"Look at them... They all said that they gave me their one and only true love, but did they? In reality, I was just one of their many lovers.\"\nSachi did not know when or where he had heard the saying, but it blurted out from his mouth in his moment of annoyance:\n\"With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?\""

After all, he was a galactic sage who was over a thousand years old. So of course he knew that girls were easily hurt, and that they could become trouble very easily. Ike would thus never cheat a girl — take notes, boys.\n\"Having seen the starry host, I thus make star-shaped jewels to remember them by,\" he continued to explain. \"But those stars that shine across the universe do not belong to anyone. So it is also impossible to steal them.\"\nVera did not understand. \"What are you saying?\"\n\"I'm saying this for the sake of a foolish fellow who isn't present right now.

As the most formidable wizard of his day, Ike was in command of gods and demons more numerous than the entries in a dictionary. But who was the strongest of those under his rule? The gods and demons decided to find out for themselves through battle.\nUnfortunately, they seemed to have erroneously regarded as their own three who were neither gods nor demons: the Princess, Sachi, and Vera.\nIke only slept for two hours, but in that time three stars had already been destroyed!\n\"Why should I protect you?\" The Princess pulled her hand away, and the giant demon plummeted to the ground, its eyeballs gone.\nThe dominant race of the Andromeda Empire may look lovely and sweet, but on their palms grow two special mouths, which they use to devour the eyeballs of their lovers and those they vanquish.\n\"Are we not friends?\" Vera wiped the blood off her face, and appeared to be hurt by the Princess' words.\n\"Yea – yes,\" The Princess blushed and looked away. \"I already regard you as my only friend for what has happened. I was not referring to you, Vera.\"\n\"No!\" Sachi yelled as the gnarly jaws of a dragon closed around him.\n\"Do you surrender to me now?\" The giant dragon jeered. \"Surrender and concede that you are worthless, lowly rats, and I shall let you live!\"\n\"I surrender! I surrender! Let me go!\" Sachi screamed.\n\"Why, a lizard of your despicable breed should know better than to utter such foolish words! Even the geckos in my palace could crush you.\" The Princess gave her wrists a twirl.\n\"No! This has nothing to do with me!\" Sachi yelled as the dragon cast him into the sky.\nAnd just like that, the battle between the dominant species of Andromeda and the ancient giant dragon was over.\nThe moral? You won't get hurt if you just surrender.\nSachi was knocked out of the contest and woke Ike up with the slap of a slipper. Vera also survived thanks to the protection of the Princess.\n\"Argh! You imbecile! The mere sight of you is revolting. Do not come near me! Don't talk to me, don't look at me, nor breathe the same air as me, you lowly scum!\" The Princess could not have a lower opinion of Sachi."

Now, something more mundane was about to happen. The date of the town festival was drawing near.\n\"I suppose it's finally my turn to introduce you two to this small town, then?\" Vera said as she served the Princess and Ike her very own braised dishes.\nAfter all, those things they had encountered in their galactic escapades had to be explained by the Princess and Ike. If there was any knowledge Vera had to present to them, it was the knowledge of her hometown.\n\"...Afterward, the great king's first messenger, the brave knight Huffman strode west across two continents, crossing great oceans and rivers. As for the imperial sage, the witch from the east, she passed by her hometown on her road eastward, and then came by the land of the Nether. Thus, they finally met here.\"\n\"Huh, is that so. How interesting.\" Though she was trying hard not to let Vera notice that she did not in fact care for the story at all, the Princess' acting skills required some work.\n\"So that can only mean that this place is on the polar opposite side of this world from the great king's capital, right?\" Ike said, commenting on a seemingly unimportant aspect of the tale.\n\"Ahahaha, that's true if you think about it.\" Vera rubbed the back of her head with a crooked smile.\n\"I've always said that I want to leave this place, but in the end, I discovered that this is the place that I'm most familiar with.\" Having come to this realization on the eve of the town's anniversary, Vera began crying right in front of Sachi's eyes.\n\"You numbskull!

I'm saying that only the Andromeda Empire would be capable of kidnapping you and the Princess.\" Ike then turned to face the innumerable lives that dwelled within the galaxy.\nHe paused for a moment before declaring thus: \"Inhabitants of the galaxy.

Afterward, she had a few words with Ike.\n\"I didn't think you could defeat the dominant species of Andromeda,\" Ike praised. \"They're a strong and hardy race. I suppose it's true, then, that you defeated the holy dragon en route to becoming the Saint King.\"\n\"I am, in fact, that same holy dragon.
