  "desc": "Thieves that come and go like the wind, though they only do so out of pure instinct.<br/>The Golden Weasel Thief is a master thief, the most adept and the rarest of all the weasel thieves.<br/>Supposedly, the weasel thief was born when one Treasure Hoarder had the unusual idea to train up wild weasels as formal members of the organization.<br/>No formal records exist, however, so the truth of this theory cannot be known. Regardless, given the size of a weasel thief's backpack, one highly doubts that they are a particularly lucrative source of wealth for the Treasure Hoarders.",
