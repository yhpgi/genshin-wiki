  "desc": "A swift, fierce fish with spiny fins whose spiny mouth can pierce the current when it swims at full speed. Its capabilities have earned it the nicknames \"The Cutter\" and \"Hard-To-Get.\"<br/>Among sticklebacks, this sort would either count as the proudest, or a rather close second place. They are especially prickly during courtships, where even the slightest breeze or smallest ripple might trip their fuse. A hobbyist once observed one such specimen charging at waving seagrass, as if such flagrant dancing was some major provocation against the stickleback king or something.<br/>\"If you encounter one underwater, do not look it in the eyes.\" — Angler's Atlas, Betta Chapter",
