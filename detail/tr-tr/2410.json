  "desc": "A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.<br/>These lizards have beautiful blue scales and will break their tails off to escape when caught.<br/>Lizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.<br/>Once they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up. They will, for reasons unknown, also turn bright green.",
