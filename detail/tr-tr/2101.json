As opposed to a weapon used to kill, it might be more fitting to consider this a tool of imprisonment.<br/>And it was the embers of that flame, which had accumulated over many long years, that would break through the frosty seal of the Delusion and apply a warped rouge upon her.<br/><br/>The crimson dawn was reflected in her pupils, and at last, she unfolded her flaming wings and flew towards the light.<br/><i>\"But that light is not the dawn, dear Rosalyne. That is a sea of flame that will consume everything.\"</i><br/>A voice spoke to her amidst the light.<br/><br/>Yet it mattered not, for she knew in her heart that the flames had devoured her long ago.",
