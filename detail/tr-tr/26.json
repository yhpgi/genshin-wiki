All my fellow adventurers would tell me something along the lines of: \"Just being around you is dangerous, I guess it's still to early for me to go on an adventure\" and they eventually all left the guild, one by one.\"\n\"In the end. I'm the only one left to take care of the elders.

Where are the undergarments I bought you?\", \"Dad, it's raining, better keep your distance from me so you don't get struck by lightning!\"\nTaking care of all his aging dads who have no family has taken up most of his time outside of adventuring.\n\"The dads certainly have found a treasure, haha!\"\nCyrus, the current Guild Master, laughed, giving Bennett a pat on the back.\nThough he is unlucky himself, he can at least try to bring luck to those he cares about. At least, that's how Bennett feels.\nBennett the Unlucky still strives to find his own lucky treasure through his series of unfortunate events."

A wealth of \"unfortunate events\" has taught Bennett how to deal with more of them in the future.\nBarbara, the Deaconess at the Church of Favonius, was once surprised by how skilled Bennett is at treating dislocated joints.\nAnother gift from his ordeals is his jaw-dropping talent for combat.\n\"Look at his moves... Doesn't that hurt?\" Grand Master Varka of the Knights was extremely intrigued after seeing Bennett in combat.\nIt's not that Bennett doesn't feel pain — he has simply gotten used to it. He adapted to the pain as others would to pungent smells or blinding light.\nTherefore, the way Bennett dives into battles head-on without reservation has become something of a signature of his."

Once over, their souls are brought back to their homeland by Barbatos.\nHe once feared death.\nHowever, after pondering on this matter some more, he now feels death may be something fortunate for an adventurer...\nNot that fortune has anything to do with him.\n\"Onto the next treasure!\" And with that, Bennett puts this thinking business behind him."

He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.\nBennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures.
