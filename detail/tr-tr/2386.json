  "desc": "A sly, prideful creature that has incredible intelligence and a long-lasting memory — or so the urban legends say.<br/>They pay no attention when someone approaches, seemingly used to living alongside mankind.<br/>The kitsune have a long history in Inazuman culture. Some legends say that they were family to the Kitsune Saiguu in ages past. After she disappeared, the mightier Sky Kitsune and Earth Kitsune turned into stone statues to await her return. As their kind slowly dwindled, the Kitsune lost their mystical might, and now no longer speak.",
