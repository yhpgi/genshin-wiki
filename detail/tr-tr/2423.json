Able to survive in various conditions, it can be encountered in all sorts of forests and wild terrain. Forest Boar meat is tasty and chewy, making it a prime ingredient for many dishes. In addition, Forest Boars are even central characters in many legends told across Teyvat.<br/>The Musk family ecologists have observed some hilichurl tribes attempting to domesticate Forest Boars, presumably hoping to train them as riding animals.",
