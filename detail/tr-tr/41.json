But as Xinyan would say to those tied down by worldly worries:\n\"If you know how to rock, then it's easier to roll.\""

Thus, she constantly looked for ways to make a change.\nEvery day when she woke up in the morning, she would look at herself in the mirror and massage her face with her fingers to stretch and relax her eyes a little.\nShe would even practice smiling and study expressions — verbal and facial alike — of great elegance.\nAfter a significant amount of practice, she once came across a group of children bullying another child, and instinctually she went over to rescue the bullied child.\nShe gave the kid what she thought was a friendly smile and a gentle pat on the head. To say that the upset child quietened down after this would not be incorrect...\nHowever, the reality of the matter was that the child was stood there frozen in fear as urine dribbled down their pants.\nAs for the would-be bullies, they screamed and fled in panic.\n\"Run! Run! The angry lady's turned into a monster! Sh—She's gonna eat us all!\"\n\"Hey!!! I ain't gonna eat y'all! ...And I ain't no monster, either!\"\nBut it was to no avail.

She intentionally eats all the experimental products, and amid the taste bud explosion that results from the never-before-seen flavors, inspiration flows into her mind.\n\"Tell you what, Xiangling, that dish rocked!\"\nThough Xinyan considers this to be the highest praise, Xiangling finds it a little hard to be happy about such ratings."

Xinyan grew to be taller than most girls, and her looks were far from anything that might be considered \"cute.\" Nor was she any good at any of the feminine arts, whether it was cooking, chores, needlework.\nSo, since her childhood was so deeply impacted by such \"prejudices,\" Xinyan understands how terrifying they could be.\nYet becoming a rock 'n' roll star has not caused her to give up on these other arts.\nThis is not only because she hates losing, but because she feels that \"giving up because you have no talent\" is itself a prejudiced belief.\nNot long ago, a fan of Xinyan's named Yun Jin was invited to her place as a guest.\nBut if Xinyan hadn't opened the door herself, Yun Jin would have thought that she had the wrong house.\nThe house was spick and span, the windows were clean, and the home ornaments were hand-made and immaculately arranged.\nThe cooktop was still moist, indicating that someone had been cooking not long before, and there was half-sewn cloth by the bedside that looked much like the decorations Xinyan wore during her performances.\nWhy, this was practically the room of some refined lady of reputable upbringing, with nary any spirit of rock 'n' roll to be found!\nXinyan was quite worried that this fan of hers would find the difference between their impression of \"rock 'n' roll\" and this reality too jarring.\nUnexpectedly, Yun Jin's support and fandom would only grow more intense after this."

After all, such mockery was born of prejudice towards her age.\nAnd if prejudice were something so easily overthrown, there would be no value in resisting it, would there?\nShe believes that rock 'n' roll is like a seed. After every performance, some seeds might sprout within the hearts of those adults who listen.\nWhen they wake up the next day, perhaps they might receive some inspiration, or perhaps a change of mood will come over them...\nEven if it only changes their thinking a little bit... Perhaps they might find that the real-life troubles they are facing are nothing but a storm in a teacup.\nOf course, few people other than her audience and the \"friends of rock\" would credit this to rock 'n' roll.\nBut people do nonetheless say this around the tables after tea.\n\"Well, having a girl who plays rock 'n' roll is pretty interesting, no?\""

Its internals can also spew flame, all the better for it to self-destruct if it falls into the wrong hands, preventing its misuse...\nThe list of modifications goes on, and they are too numerous to count.\nThis instrument is thus unique, and its sound profile is also special.\n—Sorry, what?

She broke many an instrument and played till calluses formed on both hands, but still, it was unsatisfactory.\n\"Who'd want to listen to this racket?\"\nThe rotten-tomato reviews she received were starting to get to her. She wondered if she should quit.\nSitting on top of Mt. Tianheng, she looked down over Liyue Harbor. But though the lights lit the streets and alleys of the harbor, they could not light the flame of the spirit of rock 'n' roll.\nShe considered leaving, to go someplace where rock 'n' roll was appreciated. But would this not be running away? Would it not be a betrayal of rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance?\nNo, she would not leave. She would become a \"flame\" that could light Liyue Harbor up.\nShe started experimenting with the use of fire to move people, adding sparks and explosions to her music.\nBut this was no mean feat for an ordinary person.\nWho knows how many times she must have burnt her fingers or blown her instrument up. But still, she continued to practice every single day on top of Mt. Tianheng.\nAnd perhaps it was that the gods themselves had great expectations of this new form of music that would soon grace the seven nations...\nBut regardless, the boiling-hot Vision would be the final stroke of perfection.\nXinyan dashed down the mountain and began her very first rock 'n' roll concert in Liyue Harbor.\nThus did her musical journey begin, with showers of sparks and explosions keeping time."
