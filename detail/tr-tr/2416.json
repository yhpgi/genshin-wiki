Due to humans often delegating the vital task of defense against vermin to them, they are sometimes also called \"watch-leaders.\" And though cats are free animals by nature, these \"watch-leaders\" take their rat-catching duties very seriously. In Liyue, such cats are fondly known as \"Catcher-General Kitty,\" so much so that children's books and toys of this sort are quite popular amongst kids.",
