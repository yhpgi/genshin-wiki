Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.\nSo where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.\nIn fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.\nThat Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.\nIn order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.\nNow having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?\nWhenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.\nThis process plays out every month.\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora."

That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.\nWhen the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.\nTheir correspondence left him deeply impressed.\nAs it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.\nWhen Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.\nMost of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.\nThe editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:\n\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\"\nAfter getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.\nNow, how best to celebrate... Ah yes.

As you approached, a sudden urge to prank her came over you... But even as you crept up, angling to clap her on the shoulder, she stopped singing.\n\"If you were trying to scare me, I'm afraid you're too late.\"\nAh, as one might have expected from Mona Megistus, the Astrologist. Your attempt foiled, you could only sit beside her. Clearing her throat, Mona began to speak in a professorial tone—\n\"The stars are truly lovely today, making this a fine night to watch the sky. And now that I've convinced the couple who are usually here to leave, this is now the perfect spot to conduct our class on the 'Basics of Astrology.'\"\nHuh. So that's why you hadn't seen Marvin or Marla.\n\"Then let's begin.\"\n\"'Astrology' is an umbrella term for the study of the laws that govern the movements of matter. The celestial bodies are but a shallow subject of research in this regard...\"\nYou understood the basic preamble just fine, but as she continued to speak, the topic grew more complicated, and you started to lose the plot. Still, she spoke so enthusiastically about the subject that you could not bring yourself to interrupt.\nLooking at her bright gray eyes and her constant gesticulations, you couldn't help but feel some embarrassment... Wait a moment.\n\"Did you change your clothes?\"\nSeeming to not expect your question, she seemed a little put on the spot at first, though she recovered quickly.\n\"That's right. I'm wearing these new clothes just to commemorate this momentous occasion as your astrology teacher. You can take this as a sign of... uh, respect.\"\nFeeling a little guilty, you told yourself to get serious. Slapping the sagging, sleeping cheeks of yours, you forced your eyes open and continued listening to her lecture.\n\"The laws of matter are actually very simple. Rather, it is the principles that govern humanity that are the most complex. As such, we astrologists...\"\nAll the while, you thought to yourself, don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep, don't... Zzz...\n\"Heh. What am I going to do with you...\" Your astrology master mutters."
