If you can gather all six fragments together, you can summon the true Greater Star forth. As for what this greater object looks like or what it can be used for, that has gone unstated.</p><p>Of course, in some other settings, it might be an object kept in storage by an organization known as the Akademiya, and perhaps its recorded name might even be the Parvo Core. There is a thin layer of dust over this object due to a long period of disuse.</p>",
