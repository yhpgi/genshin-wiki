Once the pattern is completed, a certain door may open.<br/>\"I yearn for those frosty skies to stand in flames and burn till there's no living soul in the world.\"<br/>\"I yearn for us to turn to dust carried by the wind so that we can find that outsider who abandoned the princess.\"<br/>\"I yearn for the black dragon from the princess' dreams to engulf the land in a cloud of scarlet poison.\"<br/>\"For I am the last one. There's no need to keep watch any longer.\"<br/>\"I've heard of people who are building a new nation without gods. Perhaps they'll have the power to stand against this world.\"",
