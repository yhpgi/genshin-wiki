However, should this affect law and order at the site and delay the progress of the construction project, the slaves of these slaves shall be executed, and their owners shall be given double the punishment.\nSlave wages shall be paid in silver, and each supervising officer shall pay out the wages according to rank.\nDispatch the strong to lay pillar foundations for the flower garden.\nDispatch the skillful to carve patterns in the base of the pillars.\nDispatch the clever to design and prepare the furnishings for the people who shall come.\nDispatch the meticulous to prepare delicacies for the able who will surely come.\nThe remaining slaves are to be sent to break the rocky mountains into stones, cut trees into logs, and build the roofs with their strength.\nIt should not take more than twenty days from the excavation of the first shovelful of earth to the planting of the last flower.\nEngrave the causes for laxness,\nSo that the generations who come after may know of such preposterous conduct,\nAnd that even the most lax of workers may remain alert and ask to do more blessed labor.\nDay 1\nThe wise man named Nefumat cried out that his residence had caught fire for reasons unknown, rendering him unable to contribute his wisdom. He took leave for one day.\nDay 7\nThree people were scorched by the radiant sun, and they took one day off.\nDay 10\nThe wise man named Nefumat cried out that he had forgotten to shut the windows of his residence, and the sand had piled up to his ankles. He was unable to offer wisdom and took leave for one day.\nDay 14\nFour people were choked by sweeping sand, and they took one day off.\nDay 18\nThe wise man called Nefumat cried out that he had eaten bread left for more than 500 days by mistake and was experiencing pain in his belly. He was unable to offer wisdom and took leave for one day.\nDay 21\nTen people were scorched by the radiant sun, and they took one day off.\nDay 25\nThe wise man called Nefumat cried out once again that the weather was hot and he could not sleep at night, causing his mind to grow drowsy. He took leave for one day.\nThis person was not incapable of contributing knowledge but was unwilling to do so. Should they offend again, they will be expelled from the city of Gurabad.\nDay 26\nNefumat fled.\nDay 27\nFour people were crushed by a boulder. Surely this is because some insolent soul insulted Al-Ahmar. The divination has yielded dire portents. Work has been stopped."
