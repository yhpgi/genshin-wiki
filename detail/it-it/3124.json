Who made them, and who carries them now? Though Haravatat researchers believe this to be a symbol for a giant serpent, Amurta researchers have proposed a different view, arguing that the Great Red Sand is not home to any snakes. As such, the meaning of and inspiration for this word is still being contested.</p>",
