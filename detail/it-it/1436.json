  "desc": "Slowly stewed local cuisine. Well-honed temperature control has allowed every ingredient to be cooked just right. This is it â€” the exact same aroma that you smell, simple yet surpassing many delicacies, when you take a stroll through Konda Village at night. Surely a village local roaming abroad would begin to miss home if they were to eat this dish so made by you.",
