  "desc": "The first part of a traditional Inazuman novel. This particular volume is also known as \"Shinkageuchi,\" and was once a restricted text. It contains a fantastical tale about the first Raiden Shogun and her kagemusha, depicting the benevolent sagacity of the first Shogun and the great valor of her kagemusha. However, due to the great popularity of another book known colloquially as \"Raiden Reincarnation,\" many people became interested in stories of this kind. This book thus wound up being published in a haphazard manner.",
