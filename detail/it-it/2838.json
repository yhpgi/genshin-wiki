Someone invented an \"Ultra-Hot Burner Lamp\" that utilizes the energy of minerals to juice up the heat, all the better to save time and increase cooking efficiency.</p><p>The one you have is a test model for civilian use with power constraints and a dimmer flame, which should reduce its fire hazard rating. Even so, this convenient gadget is still perfectly capable of cooking jam and drying sausages with ease.</p>",
