  "desc": "The heirloom blade of the Iwakura Clan.<br/>Although the one who forged this blade possessed great skills, and though it is true that this sword has slain many a foe, it does not possess any special powers. Nor has the Iwakura Succession ever obtained a Vision. Their excellent swordsmanship was purely a result of their honing of mind, body, and technique.<br/>This blade has been submerged in water for a long time and seems to have completely rusted.",
