Should any slave choose to receive no pay for work, they can redeem themselves and become civilians after a period of 100 days.\nEach supervising officer shall pay out the wages according to rank, and make a record of redeemed persons.\nThe power of the spring is eternal, and the workshop runs without rest. One day is worth a thousand days of slaves working with their bare hands, and there is no risk of being remiss.\nThis is all thanks to the love and wisdom of the Spirit of Victory, Parvezravan, who will spread these springs of power throughout his territory like scattered seeds.\nSlaves shall be freed wherever the seeds sprout, henceforth enabling them to feed themselves. Yellow sands shall become cultivated fields, the oasis a town.\nDispatch the skillful to watch for rot on flying shuttles at all hours.\nDispatch the clever to ponder the beauty of textile patterns.\nDispatch the meticulous to observe if the springs of power shall wane.\nDispatch the remaining slaves to mash petals into dyes, and weave grass into cloth.\nSend maid to rouse slaves to work like birds at sunrise, and to guide slaves to rest at sunset like the stars and the moon.\nIt should not take more than thirty days, from the weaving of the first piece of fabric to the completion of three thousand pieces of clothing.\nEngrave the causes for laxness,\nSo that the generations who come after may know of such preposterous conduct,\nAnd that even the most lax of workers may remain alert and ask to do more blessed labor.\nDay 1\nThe maid named Etta claimed that she had forgotten to shut the windows of her residence, and the sand had piled up to her knees. She was unable to sing and took leave for one day.\nDay 7\nTwo people were scorched by the radiant sun, and they took one day off.\nDay 10\nThe maid named Etta said she drank staid water that had been left for over 300 days, causing pain in her belly and rendering her unable to sing. She took one day off.\nDay 14\nOne person was choked by sweeping sand, and they took one day off.\nDay 18\nThe maid named Etta said that her residence had unexplainably caught fire. She was unable to sing and took leave for one day.\nDay 21\nTwo people were scorched by the radiant sun, and they took one day off.\nDay 25\nThe maid named Etta said that the weather was too hot for her to sleep at night. She felt dizzy and took leave for one day.\nThis person was not incapable of contributing but was unwilling to sing for Al-Ahmar. Should they offend again, they will be expelled from the city of Gurabad.\nDay 26\nEtta claimed that a friend of hers was a very clever person, and this friend could come and design fabric patterns. This was allowed.\nDay 27\nThree people were choked by sweeping sand, and they took one day off."
