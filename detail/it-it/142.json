If you view small fox statues with this lens, you can find things that were not there before.<br/>They say that in the distant past, the legendary Kitsune Saiguu left a catalyst for the then-Hiiragi Clan head, Hiroshi, as a tool to be used in exorcisms.<br/>The Hiiragis would have a special Kamera made to order from overseas with that catalyst mounted on its lens assembly, before giving it back to the Grand Narukami Shrine as a symbol of their friendship.",
