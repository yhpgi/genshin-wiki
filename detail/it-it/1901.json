  "desc": "A dish that requires great precision to make. The finely diced chicken breast is stirred vigorously and added into a soup with various other minced meats, before being cooked over a small flame. The result is light and elegant, and it tastes like tofu pudding. The meat is presented in such a form that the experience of consuming it is like tasting the finest chicken one has ever eaten, yet without appearing to have eaten chicken at all. This is part of Liyue's culinary fine arts.",
