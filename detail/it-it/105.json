Also known to a certain someone as \"strips of paper.\"<br/>You can only get one of these per day, which will cause the previous day's fortune slip to lose meaning and disappear.<br/>They say that slips that portend ill luck such as \"Misfortune\" and \"Great Misfortune\" can be tied to the Fortune Slip Hanger as a prayer for a turnaround.<br/>Regardless, \"fate\" and \"destiny\" are things best grasped and forged in one's own hands.",
