The Millelith seem to enjoy collecting these tough feathers to use as ornaments.<br/>It is said that eagle feathers fit valiant warriors best, and so tend to be used to decorate the armor and arms of the bravest, such that they might break the enemy formation with all the swiftness of that great bird of prey.",
