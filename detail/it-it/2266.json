However, it has strange and unique properties: When it falls, it maintains a regular shape and its cross-section still keeps its mirrored sheen. Those of these rocks that are older may have witnessed that ancient battle.</p><p>These stones can be exchanged for treasures during \"Perilous Trail.\"</p>",
