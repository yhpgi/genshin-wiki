This volume tells of the origins of Jin the Seventy-Second's revenge.\nA single sword's light pierced the night air, unchallenged by any star or moon.\nThe autumn wind in the mountains wept aloud, following the whirling dance of the lonesome blade.\nDriving wind and falling rain accompanied a single traveler on his solitary journey.\nThis person's hair was wild, and his face fierce, and he seemed most fey indeed. His clothes were thin, and he swayed this way and that in the center of the homeward path like one sick or hurt to the quick, seeming more like some ghoul than a living man.\nHe had been on the path three days. Three days he had gone hungry, and without any sleep.\nThree days ago, he had a name and a famed sword, and his fallen martial arts school. But now, he only wore sorrow and worry on his brow, which rolled off him, carried by the sudden rain, and onto the mud below, eroding the soil.\nThree days ago, that nameless swordsman had started a feud with him, a feud that saw his master and junior buried in the merciless mountain snow as the screaming snow was stained red.\nToday, he had a new name — Jin the Seventy-Second.\nFor he was the last of the 72 members of their school.\n—\nHe did not know how long he had walked before he heard the sound of carts behind him.\nJin the Seventy-Second shuffled to the side of the road and stopped, asking: \"Is your cart headed for Tupi Village?\"\nThe cart driver saluted him and replied: \"Few of the carts on this road do not do so.\"\nJin the Seventy-Second then asked: \"Then pray will your cart bear another man?\"\nThe cart driver said: \"It could, but you did not ask if I would.\"\nJin the Seventy-Second did not understand. \"If you travel to Tupi Village, why would you not take me?\"\n\"For you are not I, nor I, you,\" the driver replied.\n\"What a waste of words.\"\nAnd no sooner had that been said than the blade left its sheath. The cart driver felt but a single chilling cold, and fell from his cart to the floor without a struggle, never to speak again.\nJin the Seventy-Second was just such a person. Though he had lost everything, even his heart, and his bold brashness had ebbed, he had always hated pointlessly talkative people most of all.\nRiding the bloodstained cart, Jin the Seventy-Second departed for Tupi Village."

This volume tells of Jin the Seventy-Second's arrival in Tupi Village.\nThey say that in that faraway land, \"Tupi\" meant to burn away vanity's dross to attain the gem of truth.\nTupi Village lay at the foot of a barren mountain, passable to the outside world only by a single ancient path — the very same that lay beneath Jin the Seventy-Second's feet.\nThe skies were darkening, and the wind and rain howled.\nJin the Seventy-Second had never had anything to do with Tupi Village but for his vengeance, and so he now sought out its village chief.\nBy the time the oxcart had finally trudged its way through the muddy old road to the mountain's base, night fell upon the land, and gloomy clouds cast a boundless shadow as they covered the moon's eyes. Jin the Seventy-Second hid in that shade, drinking the night in, body and soul.\nIn that deep night, the pure white light of the moon shone upon the head of the village chief. Tupi Village had never been large, but the chief was no ordinary character. No one knew his name or his past, and no one dared ask.\nThey only knew that his shoulders bore a great blood debt, from a past as crimson as his eyes.\nFor red they were, and sharp, like a blade, piercing the hearts of all he gazed upon as he pleased.\nHis character was much the same, like a sharp knife that might pierce another person's heart at any time without forewarning.\n\"It's time.\"\nThe chief shook his head as he talked to himself, the cold moonlight dancing over his shaven crown.\nOutside, a ravenous demon wielded a blood-letting long sword, massacring his followers one after the other.\nThough Tupi Village was full of evil people, schools and sects had their rules, and so none would dare come knocking with rash provocations and talk of revenge.\nBut Jin the Seventy-Second had no school or sect, and was thus unbound by any such rules. He was but a single starving ghost with a lone sharp blade, yearning to taste the blood of his enemies.\nThe wind and rain accompanied the din of battle, and the downpour washed away the crimson that stained the swordsman, only for another layer to be painted on immediately...\nThe crimson swordsman strode forward amid a crimson mist. Many were his wounds, but none could stay his hand.\nWhen that mist had at last cleared in the endless deluge, the swordsman crossed the turbid red beneath his feet, and stalked towards the chief's mansion.\n—\nThe din beyond the gates quieted, and only now did the chief raise a cup of wine, and scatter the alcohol into the air with a flick.\nPerhaps to toast the fated meeting to come, or as a ritual for his sullied soul.\nThe doors opened. It was Jin the Seventy-Second, his reddened outline juxtaposed against the blinding gray elements outside.\n\"I have questions for you, village chief.\"\n\"You've taken quite a few of my men's lives.\"\n\"Exactly three hundred and sixty-two. No more, no less...\"\nThe chief spoke naught, and his face remained still, but the pulsing vein in his temple betrayed the fire within.\n\"...Ah yes, and one dog.\"\nSo saying, the crimson silhouette tossed a certain object forward. It clattered atop the wine case...\n...And it was the bone of the dog that guarded the door. It had been stewed for a time and was picked clean almost to the marrow.\nFor in this half an hour, not only had Jin the Seventy-Second snuffed out the lives of three hundred and sixty-two able men, but he had even turned the dog keeping the gate into dog meat stew.\nWhat cruelty.\nWhat ruthlessness!\nThe village chief let out a terrible scream, and standing, he drew his sword—"

This volume tells of Jin the Seventy-Second's duel with the chief of Tupi Village.\nThe rain had ceased, but light had yet to recoup the skies.\nJin the Seventy-Second had obtained news of his nemesis from the mouth of the village chief.\nNow, not a thing was left in Tupi Village but masterless rooms and masterless spirits.\nAnd not even that remained, for this was a world without spirits.\nThis world possessed no elemental power.\nAnd so, the memories of the dead could not remain in the mortal realm via elemental resonance.\nThe village chief was a formidable foe. His blade was swift as could be, and he had left many wounds on Jin the Seventy-Second, each deep enough to cut bone.\nBut alas, his \"heart\" was far too slow.\nFor this was a world without elements.\nAnd thus swordsmanship could not be imbued with them.\nSwordsmanship was thus a question of pure physical skill and not elemental control.\nThe sword is an extension of one's body, and one uses it as an arm would command the fingers, or as one's heart directs the eyes.\nThough he was skilled indeed in the art of the swift blade, the village chief never understood the value of the \"heart,\" and so he fell to a single stroke.\nJin the Seventy-Second strode towards the fallen chief, discarding the broken incense burner in his left hand.\nFor the chief had focused too narrowly on pouring savage strokes upon the swordsman's body, thinking him too harried to fight back, and had no eyes for his enemy's left hand, which should have been empty—\n—And in a flash, the incense burner had struck the chief of Tupi Village on the forehead, sending him tumbling into a wall where he then collapsed, immobile.\n\"Underhanded villain...\"\nBut only the wind answered him — the villain gripping the bloodied censer said not a word.\n\"...The person you're looking for is in the barren mountains beyond this village... Go seek your death there...\"\nBut the villain had departed, and all that remained to answer him was the rustling of the wind...\nAnd the crackling of wild flames."

This volume tells of Jin the Seventy-Second's treacherous trek into the mountains.\nJin the Seventy-Second waited till the rainbow had dispersed before setting off once from Tupi Village toward the barren mountains.\nAncient legend held that these barren mountains had been brought into being by slices from the Celestial Emperor's blade, and thus were incredibly hard to scale.\nFolk tales also held that they were called barren, for they had soaked up the tears of the Earth Mother, and thus had become bitterly salty lands where nothing grew.\nThe barren mountains had once been mined for gold and gems, but the mines had all been ruined in an earthquake, their workers buried within.\nNo one tried ever again to create the facilities to mine the mountain's bounty, and its caverns were infested with wicked beasts and bandits.\nAnd among these evils hidden in the mountains was Jin the Seventy-Second's nemesis.\nThe swordsman's shoulders shivered, and his gait hesitant, for the wounds he had been given in the battle against the chief of Tupi Village hindered him still.\nHe knew that many pairs of eyes stared out at him from between the wither rocks, and the breath of beasts who had caught the scent of his blood was all around.\nLong years of bloodshed had honed Jin the Seventy-Second's senses to their limit.\nHe sensed that the lifeless mountains were in fact a giant death trap.\nBandits and villains lay in wait for him to enter some narrow grotto, or squeeze into a tiny gorge, or pass by a collapsed mine shaft. Then, they would set upon him in the darkness with knives, and finish him.\nBut from the looks of things now, the steep mountains now looked like they might be enough to kill Jin the Seventy-Second.\nThe swordsman limped with every step he took, and the road was small and treacherous. Every so often, gravel would slip loose beneath his feet.\nAt the same time, upon a cliff twisted about with sinuous, dead trees, two figures squinted as they observed the tiny wanderer.\n\"He has been worse for wear since he departed from the mountain's base. If we but leave him to the treacherous trek, he will surely fall into the abyss below.\"\nSo said a bone-thin old crone.\nShe glanced to her side, icy death in her jade-blue eyes, sharp as a viper hidden in a rocky cleft.\n\"Not so!\"\nShe turned to face the booming voice of a corpulent old man.\n\"He slew three hundred and sixty-two at Tupi Village, and even cooked the dog at the gate for stew.\"\n\"Though he may have been badly wounded by the village chief to the point where he can barely move, we should still beware of him.\"\n\"Hmph...\"\nThe old woman vanished into the withered forest with a displeased noise.\n\"...\"\nThe old man watched a while longer as the lame swordsman stopped for a moment more, before patting his large belly and slowly departing.\nNot a single withered tree or blade of dying grass was touched as he did.\nThen suddenly the sky turned dark with gathering stormclouds, and mordant rain again began to fall lightly.\nIn the mountain rain, the wounded Jin the Seventy-Second leaned on his sword like a crutch, and struggled forward.\nBut the chilling cold and the loss of blood was too much for him to bear, and he fell upon the gravel and barren stone.\nJust as the darkness took him, he caught a glimpse of the billowing hem of azure-blue skirts...\nHe could've sworn he'd seen that sight before."
