Due to this trait, it can detect the presence of Electroculi.<br/>Across the span of endless years, even the most majestic cities and sculptures would be worn down by wind and rain, and even the power of Statues of The Seven would gradually dissipate. But this faded strength would coalesce once more into the Oculi, which call out wordlessly to their Statues.",
