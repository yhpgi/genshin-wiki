A real shame, of course, that it looks so very majestic. As such, it lost the nickname \"Descendant of Dragons,\" and is now termed the \"False Dragon\" instead.",

Very strong-willed, it will fight any interloper that dares to steal its food or enter its territory. In terms of pure fighting capability, it is even a match for smaller sea creatures and has thus been given the nickname \"Ironbone Dragon\" in honor of its strength, which is considered the backbone of its species' future revitalization.",

Perhaps passing on the bitterness of life is also a manifestation of love.",
