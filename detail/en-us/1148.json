People call me the Enchantress of the Night.\"\nAs she spoke, her long golden hair began to gradually darken, eventually turning black as the night sky outside the window. Her once sky-blue eyes were now pitch-black, ushering in the darkness of night.\n\"I am your master now. Of course, I will need to train you well.\"\nNottfriga knelt down and placed a necklace that seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the still struggling Dietrich. The necklace shrank in size until it fit perfectly around his furry neck. No matter how he thrashed his head about or clawed at it, the necklace would not budge.\n\"Tsk, we've already wasted so much time. Come, we're leaving.\"\nWith that, Nottfriga set off towards the city. Dietrich whimpered along the way with all the strength he could muster, wishing he could simply run back to his villa. But he couldn't, no matter how hard he tried. The necklace Nottfriga had placed on him seemed to somehow control him, so he had no choice but to follow behind her.\nNottfriga glanced back at the reluctant Dietrich dawdling behind her, and curled a strand of her hair around her finger.\n\"Although it is certainly amusing to watch you struggle in your current state, you are much too noisy. So unless you'd like a taste of my new Silence of the Night spell, you'd better keep your yapping mouth shut.\"\nThe whole world seemed to fall into silence at that moment. Intuition told Dietrich that it'd be best not to become the latest test subject for Nottfriga's new spell."
