All it took was a single glance for her to know all the terrain inside and out, and her maps were very precise too.\nBut she left for some mining area.

There, she worked as a cartographer, studying and researching the underground mines. Being akin to miners, Zhiqiong was accustomed to navigating the dangerous underground passages and knew them like the back of her hand. Soon after her arrival, the miners dug up a \"thing\" in the mines that they called the Wish Granter. The workers believed that if they approached it, any wish would come true. After the appearance of this \"thing,\" Lumenspars began to appear everywhere in the mines, and the changes in the geological structure of The Chasm accelerated: black matter began to appear, covering the stones, dark mud, and oozing concretions spread throughout the mines. The influence of the Wish Granter and the dark mud began to drive the miners crazy, and the Qixing was forced to seal off the mine. After The Chasm was closed, Zhiqiong became an adventurer. Although she had only completed a few commissions for the Adventurers' Guild, she was inspired by great adventurers like Stanley, Roald, and Leonard, so when the Ministry of Civil Affairs asked Zhiqiong to go into the depths of The Chasm as part of an exploration team, she immediately agreed, hoping to leave her mark for future generations to remember. The adventurer believed that The Chasm could become her Rubicon. Because of Zhiqiong's talent in cartography, her task was to create a new map of The Chasm's underground mines, which had changed after the incident."

This shard was the Wish Granter that had caused The Chasm mines to be sealed. When they saw the shard, it was tainted with filth, and Zhiqiong felt ill again, but once the crystal was cleansed, she seemed to be able to breathe easier. Before descending into the deepest part of The Chasm, Khedive had warned Zhiqiong that being there could be fatal for her, but despite all the persuasion and orders, she refused to return. She was an adventurer, and risk was part of her life. Zhiqiong didn't want to lie in bed in her dotage, withered by age, relying on others to eat or even to get herself to the toilet. It was better for her to die during an adventure than to lie in some cushy bed waiting for time to claim her. She wasn't interested in a comfortable job with the Ministry or Khedive's reward, because she wanted to prove that people who didn't have a Vision and weren't noticed by the gods' grace could achieve anything. She believed that this was the only way she could inspire those who came after her and show them how far a mortal who wasn't chosen by the gods could go and what kind of history they could leave behind. And even if she wouldn't succeed, she wanted to remain in people's memory."
