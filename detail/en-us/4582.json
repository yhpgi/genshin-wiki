There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...\nOr perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.\nThis darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.\nIn those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.\nNo one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.\nWhen his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.\nThus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.\nThis would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior."
