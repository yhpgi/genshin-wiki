His figure grew smaller and smaller until it became a tiny white spot, which blended into the dandelion sea and slowly faded away.\nAfter he had gone, the mother fox turned and walked over to me.\nThe closer she drew, the greater in stature she became.\nBy the time she stood before me, she had transformed into a human.\nShe was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water — in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops.\n\"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\"\nI thought to myself.\nFor all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, still nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the boundless dandelion sea.\nAt last, I could no longer contain myself, and opened my mouth:\n\"Is this the magic you wanted to teach me? The magic of transformation?\"\n\"It is. I am most grateful to you for all your help over this long period.\"\nShe bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams.\nAlthough saying farewell to the little fox left emptiness in my heart, I soon became exhilarated at the thought of the transformation magic that I was about to learn.\nCould I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef.\n\"I could even use magic to hunt!\" I couldn't contain my excitement. \"No more meatless carrot stews for me...\"\n\"Then I shall ask you to stand still.\"\nShe walked circles around me, her stature growing with every pass.\nNo, not just her. The dandelions were also growing in size! They had only been at my ankles when she started, but now stretched to over my waist, growing as if turning into towering trees.\nIt was only when I started to feel strange that I realized that the fox had become a giant."
