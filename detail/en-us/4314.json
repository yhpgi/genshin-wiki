I may soon no longer be able to care for you as I once did.\"\n\"Please, choose a husband for yourself. All would be honored to be the one.\"\nThe daughter replied,\n\"If it shall be so, Mother, please have me wed to the most powerful being in this world.\"\n\"Ah, and that would be the sun,\" the fox said. \"My son-in-law you shall be, O sun shining in the sky.\"\n\"No,\" the sun refused. \"These clouds are more powerful, for they block my radiance.\"\n\"So it is, then. Flowing clouds, those who block the sun's radiance, please marry my daughter.\"\n\"Oh, that won't do! The wind blows me away so easily. You're better off entrusting her to the wind!\"\nBut the wind was stopped by a mountain, and so the fox went to it.\nAnd the mountain demurred, citing conflicts with a mouse.\nThat mouse, when enraged, could bore a tunnel through the mountains,\nThus, it was mightier by far than the mountains, was it not?\nThe mouse suggested the cat, the cat the dog, and the dog, the wolf.\nAfter having gone through the entire cycle, the Fox found herself facing the sun once more.\nAs thus did the young beauty marry the sun.\nThe story tells the truth that one should accept their destiny, instead of making excuses and trying to evade to the end.\nNo matter how honest, or how cunning, one can never escape the duty one ought to shoulder."
