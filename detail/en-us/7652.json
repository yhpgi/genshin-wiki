The crispy crust is like a small, golden castle, stoutly protecting chunks of succulent eel, juicy squab, and tender foie gras, all swimming in a rich mushroom sauce. A chorus of different flavors hits your tongue at once, with a complexity and richness deserving of its own footnote in history. Escoffier's culinary tour de force is enough to move you to your very soul.",
