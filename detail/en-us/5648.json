Particles can be of one of the 7 elements or can be of clear color. Within the first category, an elemental particle can be of the same element as a character, or of a different one. Also, the character can be on-field or off-field when the particles are caught. These different combinations result in varying energy gained based on the situation, represented in the table below.\nAs an example: If the element of the particle/orb and character are identical, the amount of energy gained will be 300% of its base; for a clear one, 200%; and if their elements differ, 100%. If the character is on-field, they receive the full 100%; if not, just 60% (or 70% or 80% if there are only 3 or 2 members in the party respectively)."
