Though it is not the original design or intended use, the energy of the Xenochromatic Ball Octopus can push the receiver nodes, pushing the feather valve to operate in one direction. After the current stops, the feather valve will <color=#ffe14b>automatically revolve back to its original position</color> . Associated or connected mechanisms will operate along with the valve.\nSometimes the missing receiver nodes need to be found."
