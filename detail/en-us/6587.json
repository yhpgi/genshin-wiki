A Saurian-Crowned Warrior once said that he fought with a Wayob in a trance while practicing his skills, and in doing so, gained deeper understanding.<br>The Scions of the Canopy believe their Wayob has the power to control the growth of fruits and leaves, and can also control the roots of crops and draw the patterns of the veins of leaves.",
