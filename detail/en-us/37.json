Well, you'll see.\"\nThat was the warning Mona received before departing.\nTo Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.\nThe box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box.\n\"I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this...\"\nMona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence."

That's a lie.\"\n\"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you.\"\nThe cold, hard truth is laid bare before people' eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.\nMona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.\nBut sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.\nThere, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself."

If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.\nMona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.\nSo where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.\nIn fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.\nThat Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.\nIn order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.\nNow having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?\nWhenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.\nThis process plays out every month.\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora."

The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.\nDoes she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat?

Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.\nAnd it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her.\n\"Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs.\"\nThis was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...\nMona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.\nWhen she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.\nPerhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life."

That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.\nWhen the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.\nTheir correspondence left him deeply impressed.\nAs it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.\nWhen Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.\nMost of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.\nThe editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:\n\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\"\nAfter getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.\nNow, how best to celebrate... Ah yes.

A costume made specifically to encompass the astrological concept of \"the destined moment\", thanks to the 30% discount ticket she got from the planetarium refund.\nBy the time you arrived at Starsnatch Cliff, Mona had already been waiting for you for some time.\nShe was looking up at the starry sky, a song you did not recognize on her lips. As you approached, a sudden urge to prank her came over you... But even as you crept up, angling to clap her on the shoulder, she stopped singing.\n\"If you were trying to scare me, I'm afraid you're too late.\"\nAh, as one might have expected from Mona Megistus, the Astrologist. Your attempt foiled, you could only sit beside her. Clearing her throat, Mona began to speak in a professorial tone—\n\"The stars are truly lovely today, making this a fine night to watch the sky. And now that I've convinced the couple who are usually here to leave, this is now the perfect spot to conduct our class on the 'Basics of Astrology.'\"\nHuh. So that's why you hadn't seen Marvin or Marla.\n\"Then let's begin.\"\n\"'Astrology' is an umbrella term for the study of the laws that govern the movements of matter. The celestial bodies are but a shallow subject of research in this regard...\"\nYou understood the basic preamble just fine, but as she continued to speak, the topic grew more complicated, and you started to lose the plot. Still, she spoke so enthusiastically about the subject that you could not bring yourself to interrupt.\nLooking at her bright gray eyes and her constant gesticulations, you couldn't help but feel some embarrassment... Wait a moment.\n\"Did you change your clothes?\"\nSeeming to not expect your question, she seemed a little put on the spot at first, though she recovered quickly.\n\"That's right. I'm wearing these new clothes just to commemorate this momentous occasion as your astrology teacher. You can take this as a sign of... uh, respect.\"\nFeeling a little guilty, you told yourself to get serious. Slapping the sagging, sleeping cheeks of yours, you forced your eyes open and continued listening to her lecture.\n\"The laws of matter are actually very simple. Rather, it is the principles that govern humanity that are the most complex. As such, we astrologists...\"\nAll the while, you thought to yourself, don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep, don't... Zzz...\n\"Heh. What am I going to do with you...\" Your astrology master mutters."
