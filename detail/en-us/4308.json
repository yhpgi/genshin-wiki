Actually, I felt the same way when I traveled to Sumeru with Jakob and Karl. Empty buildings feel lonely, yet enduring at the same time... In the apocalypse, stone structures outlive humans a million times over. It's the same here. So, to a certain extent, it's just a bit of apocalyptic scenery... The director has been observing these scenes for so long, so I'm sure she feels much of the same sorrow. I should visit her when I have the time... Build a new home and bring her over? Jakob would be happy too.\n...Jakob left behind the feather ornament given to him by the vice director, the same ornament he'd been keeping carefully... As a result, we never used it as a wand to play any games...\n...I discovered that this place was very likely an ancient... facility. If so, I should be able to find useful data... The script's content...\n...I'll visit the director again next time. I heard Mary-Ann will be coming to see her too. It would be nice if we could meet. After all, right now Alain is..."
