Thus, in his troubled dreams, Sanhaj revealed his brother's scheme.\nMama Dream-Realm stretched out her hands as black as night, embracing the honest Sanhaj and kissing his brow. In the dark, silent dream, she had already forgiven Sanhaj's crimes. Indeed, as a reward for his honesty, she poured the mysterious mushroom wine into an obsidian cup and handed it to him.\nHowever, at this moment, Kompore burst into his brother's tent and threw a rough hemp rope around his sleeping brother's neck â€” long had he known that his brother would reveal his plan to the Lord of the Crossroads.\nAnd so, before the master of dreams could even issue a warning, Sanhaj met his end at the hands of his own brother. The obsidian cup filled with mushroom wine slipped from his grasp, staining his chest and the bloodsoaked hemp rope tightly wound around his neck.\nThis grave crime enraged the Lord of the Crossroads, who grieved Sanhaj's death. He immediately laid a curse upon the cunning Kompore: his unhappy brother Sanhaj would be resurrected within him, and would prophesize the fullness of his fate. From that moment on, all those he had deceived and murdered would be forever etched in his memory; and every lie he had ever told, his brother would repeat a thousand times over in his ear. Thus did Kompore gain the boon from drinking the mushroom wine, yet stain himself with an indelible sin and curse.\nSo it was that Kompore gained a new name, \"Sanhaj Kompore.\" Only much, much later, when Tenoch mustered heroes for a final stand against the wild, pitch-black torrent, did he finally find a way to redeem himself... but that is another story. Haha, likewise, since many tribespeople have witnessed Sanhaj Kompore's scheming smile in the pitch-dark night, even after that decisive day of battle... that story must surely be yet another of Sanhaj Kompore's jokes or riddles."
