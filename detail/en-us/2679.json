Henceforth, it reaped only sights of oblivion, of an endless calamity.</p><p>Apep found itself swallowed alone amidst the scenery of the catastrophe.

Then, finally, the young god and the golden Traveler let it recall once again, even though the verdant land it once ruled had been reduced to this gilded wasteland, even though Apep and its many offspring had grown twisted and wretched to secure their continued survival therein, Apep still treasured the sight and scenes of the oasis, sparkling in its heart.</p>",
