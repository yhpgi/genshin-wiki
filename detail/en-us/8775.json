  "desc": "The Voynich Guild developed this hovering daybed using artifacts unearthed from the pioneering age.<br>Once activated, it hovers slightly above ground, allowing you to rest on it anywhere in the wild. A remarkable creation indeed!<br>Despite the Voynich Guild's best efforts at reverse-engineering, the daybed remains somewhat unstable â€” the technology of the pioneering age remains unfathomable to this day.<br>It is said that when the earliest hovering daybed was discovered, it was buried alongside a mechanical cat, leading some to call it the \"King Size Cat Bed.\"<br>\"No! It couldn't possibly be a cat bed. Everyone knows cats don't sleep in their own beds!\"",
