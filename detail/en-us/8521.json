Across the frozen northern plain,\nFrom the holy citadel to the ancient capital, dark blue crystal nails annihilated every last city with even the most minuscule sign of life.\nThe once-praised apostle and the gods' first messenger both vanished in the catastrophe.\nThose who survived by grace of being nowhere near the cities at the time could only cling to life amidst the freezing wind and snow.\nWith no refuge left to them, they simply waited for destruction to find them in the hollow dark.\nThis is the great extinction spoken of in later prayers. Halcyon prosperity turned to dust,\nAnd the gods remained silent, unmoved by cries, curses, or reproach.\nIn the despair of that long night, only one celestial ruler shed tears for the mortals' pain.\nShe was the mistress of the Frost Moon, queen of the celestial chariot and of light, a heavenly agent whose origin was one with that of the world.\nMoved by pity, and a deeper, unspoken wish, she heeded the survivors' prayers.\nAccording to legend, she spun gleaming threads from the silver glow to lead the displaced across the frozen plains.\nAnd where her tears, full of longing, fell upon the frost-covered soil of the far north, they blossomed into lilies that would stand eternal in the icy winds.\nThe proud descendants of Hyperborea call themselves the \"Frostmoon Scions\" for this reason,\nTo honor the divinity who, whatever her original intent, gave them a new lease on life."

My older sister, the only one I ever truly trusted.\"\n\"But I won't resent you... I have long lost hope for the sky beyond.\""

So it should have been. So it should have been...\nBut on a moonless, snowbound night, the girl chosen to bear the sacred heir met the boy from the northern realm,\nAnd in his eyes, as clear as a winter's day, she beheld a reflection of a self she had never known.\nThis unfamiliar stirring was enough to make the holy woman turn her back on destiny for that young officer from afar.\nFor this new feeling, this foolishness called love, she cut off her bloodstained antler-crown and cast it down upon the snowy earth.\nThe fallen one, who had betrayed her own people, ultimately failed to fulfill her destined duty.\nShe was captured by a spy sent by the mad monk and was soon to be returned to the homeland she was meant to love.\nBut as she looked down at the officer by her feet, crimson pooling beneath him, she drew the dagger to her throat in one final, fatal kiss.\nAnd so, the woman who failed to bear the sacred heir was buried in haste, her death forestalling the prophecy.\nFortunately, the leaders of every generation had long prepared for premature end of such a blessed lady.\nLovia, the then-Archpriestess, swiftly turned to a lesser branch of the bloodline for spares.\nBut the twin sisters born of this lineage were a pale shadow of the one they were meant to replace.\nHundreds of years might now have to pass before another child of sufficient purity was born.\nSeeing the glory of the great endeavor slip from her grasp like dissipating dew,\nThe antler-crowned Archpriestess, maddened by anguish and obsession, hatched a terrible scheme.\nWhy wait for the thousand winds to sweep through several generations? If they were too impure,\nTheir flesh and blood too weak to bear the radiance of true moonlight... Did the Frost Moon's boon not linger faintly in all ███?\nThen let ███ purify their ███!\nThus, in the name of flawless moonlight, the priestess committed an act so profane,\nThat even the mistress of the Frost Moon would recoil in horror at the blasphemy..."
