This device was designed to fight the Heavenly Principles, which have been asleep for five hundred years since the cataclysm in Khaenri'ah. In its primitive form, the Loom could only be used to create and implant memories, but as more of it was completed, its power became stronger and stronger. Finally, it now has the power to weave real Ley Lines of its own. Teyvat's Ley Line system is deeply entrenched in the planet, and creating new Ley Lines can neither \"replace\" nor \"extend\" the ones that already exist. Once fully completed, the moment it gained the power to weave Ley Lines, it lost the lower-level ability to influence memories. Its full potential is still to be discovered, but it can be a tool that can change the entire world."

One day, he and the Traveler discovered a talisman that had been dropped by an Abyss mage. From this talisman, they learned about the first operation of the Loom of Fate. The project itself was related to the inverted statue of the Anemo Archon, which they had previously discovered in the Liyue ruins. During the first phase, the Abyss Order intended to corrupt the mind of Osial, the Overlord of the Vortex, defeated by Rex Lapis during the Archon War, and transform his body using the ancient Khaenri'ah \"Field Tiller.\" The defiled statue of the Archon would become the base to which Osial's limbs would be attached to construct a mechanized god. The new core that would replace the orb usually held by the Statue of the Seven was supposed to be the eye of the very first Field Tiller. The new god was supposed to topple the divine thrones of Celestia."

After the destruction of Khaenri'ah, the mechanisms lost their masters and went completely out of control. They wandered the lands aimlessly for centuries and eventually scattered throughout Teyvat. To find the first Field Tiller and learn about the inverted statue, the Traveler contacted Barbara, the Deaconess of the Mondstadt church, and she told them about \"The Tyrant's Final Fury.\" Many years ago, balls of fire would rain from the sky whenever anyone approached Old Mondstadt. People at that time believed that it was a curse laid down by the\nso they referred to it as \"The Tyrant's Final Fury.\" This strange phenomenon continued for about a year. No one was ever able to solve it, it just gradually ceased on its own. The \"The Tyrant's Final Fury\" turned out to be the Field Tiller. Many years ago, it accidentally ended up in King of the North Wind's, Andrius, arena, and he mistook the mechanism for a brave man who challenged him. The machine could not think, but every part of it was designed for killing and fighting. It could spin, fly high into the air, and shoot fireballs. In the end, Andrius was able to defeat the machine, but it managed to leave the arena before falling and headed towards the Old Mondstadt. In Stormterror's Lair (Old Mondstadt), Dainsleif and the Traveler discovered the first Field Tiller, and the Twilight Sword hid its eye in his body so that it would not fall into the hands of the Abyss Order.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

To console him, his father told him a story that he found himself in a fairy tale world and took on the form of a little monster.
