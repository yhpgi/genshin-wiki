However, they devolved into brutal creatures after said adeptus passed away. These legends cannot be verified, and no one knows the true identity of this adeptus. This much is for sure, however â€” one should stay away from these aggressive creatures for one's safety.<br>For over a thousand years, these beasts have lost a tremendous amount of territory that once belonged to them to relentless human encroachment. These days, they can only occasionally be spotted in the remote mountains of Chenyu Vale...</p>",
