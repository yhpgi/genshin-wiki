Presently, only schools of fish meander through the abandoned promenades, accompanied by the solitary sound of the tides.</color>\nDuring the Khaenri'ahn Cataclysm that occurred 500 years ago, the institute's director, Dwight Lasker, decided to temporarily close the institution for safety reasons. Many young scientists were eager to fight, but the director hoped that one day they would understand the importance of rebuilding after the disaster. The Cataclysm marked the beginning of the first diluvian period, <color=#ffffff73>areas of Fontaine began to flood, and buildings would eventually submerge</color> . <color=#ffffff73>When the Institute started to flood, Dwight selected a good piece of land near the Fountain of Lucine as the post-relocation site, but the city authorities wanted to build an opera house there.</color>"

This required a bigger lab which was prepared, and although Alain had been urged to move his lab several times, he was hesitant to do so in fear his sickly assistant, Carter Scherbius, might not be able to find it. Carter suffered from a critical illness that progressed gradually throughout his time at the Institute. The illness is currently unknown but causes frequent bouts of unconsciousness. After some time, Alain did eventually move to the bigger lab. The experiments that took place here involved Khaenri'ahn machines, such as Ruin Graders, and were noted to be so dangerous an emergency damage control strategy was implemented for safety. Alain's experiments into machines were perceived by other researchers as an intention to create a mechanical dog as proof of his accomplishments in Kinematics and material science. Carter had actually suggested creating such a thinking Kamera so that it would take photos of those precious to Alain while he was busy. Alain found using a thinking Kamera for this reason to be pointless, but he found such a machine useful for security and surveillance applications. Seymour, Prototype 4ACV07, which takes the form of a mechanical dog, was the thinking machine Alain created for his adoptive sister, Mary-Ann Guillotin. Seymour was designed to protect Mary-Ann and was constructed with the most advanced optics from the Fontaine Institute of Natural Philosophy.</color>"

Rene acquired something powerful to research that appeared after the disaster which was noted to be very dangerous for most people. Jakob, whose constitution was altered by the powers of the Abyss, felt that he became \"better\" after being exposed to these materials. This research eventually led to an experiment on Carter, albeit in an attempt to save his life, which had disastrous effects on him.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>At the end of the Central Quartier of the Institute, the gathering place of an old society known as the Narzissenkreuz Ordo can be found using an indecipherable book. Although Rene found it quite sad that people from an Institute of Natural Philosophy have somewhat turned into his believers, he established the Narzissenkreuz Ordo within the Institute to give his followers a sense of belonging. The Ordo did not go unnoticed among the leaders of the Institute, but as there was no evidence of aggression or any invasive nature, the case was not pursued through official investigative channels.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>After the Institute disbanded, some of its former members joined the Narzissenkreuz Ordo at Jakob Ingold's invitation. Much of the continued research focused on the ancient civilization of Remuria. This led to the uncovering of an ancient copy of an unknown document within the Institute of Natural Philosophy containing Remurian characters that seemed to be some form of phonography.

Since the disaster, such people are even more precious.\nI thought that since he's a star of the Institute and was recommended by higher-ups, he'd be full of himself, but he's much better than I expected. He's just not especially nice or anything...\nNo obvious symptoms.\n...\n...I made a huge mistake, and knocked over an ancient geometry machine that took a lot of effort to bring back from the desert ruins. But then the machine came to life, and messed everything up...\n...Though he's a lot younger than me, he's really smart. I can't believe that's how he managed to tame the machine. Maybe taming isn't the right word? Maybe the other engineers will look down on me for using it. But it really did feel like taming... I know the current clockwork machines pretty well, so I can tell the huge technological gulf between the two. Ignoring structure, if we can't solve the power source problems, then it'll be difficult to make any meaningful progress...\nBut I still have to be careful. I've never seen Alain angry, and I don't want to find out what he looks like when he gets angry.\nA few minor symptoms have appeared.\n...\nTook the day off.\n...\nI can hardly believe it! Alain came to visit me, and even brought his sister! She's cute and not afraid of strangers. I'm so happy...\n...We discussed the idea of a thinking machine based on gems and tape circuits. I used the word \"discussed,\" but actually I just said things like \"Oh!\" or \"That's really amazing\" or \"How will you do that?\" whenever he paused, and didn't make any real contributions. He was really into it, though, and he behaved very differently than he usually does in the lab. His little sister is probably way smarter than me, a research assistant!\n...I guess it isn't that boring when it flares up, but I want to return to the Institute to help as soon as I can...\n...\n...The additional machines got here. The previous ones are no longer usable since they were completely dismantled... But it did clear up a lot of things, at least according to him. Something about it being riven by the elements in the ley lines, but we can't recreate it with our current level of industrial precision and material science. I helped with compiling the report, but there's so much I couldn't understand!\n...Apparently, lots of people are secretly unhappy that Alain has more research resources than them... But if you ask me, everyone's smarter than me, and they should all get along, that way we can make the world a better place.\n...His sister said that some of their friends are joining the Institute. I'm looking forward to meeting them...\nNo obvious symptoms.\n...\n...joined the lab as new partners! But now I'm even more confused by their conversations! Why is it I can understand every word on its own, but once they string them all together, I can't make heads or tails of it? Jakob is really the only one even close to being on the same level as me... I feel ashamed just writing that, as an adult looking for reassurance from a child as young as Jakob, I feel like I've lost all the self-respect an adult should have...\n...Based on their research on Primenergy Machinery (seems like they decided to adopt this name), Alain and Rene are thinking about trying to use the characteristics of ousia and pneuma to construct a new kinetic core...\nA few minor symptoms.\n...\n...I may have made a contribution! Well, maybe? I went on a picnic with Alain, his sister, Rene, and Jakob. It was technically supposed to be field research, but the idea came from Alain's sister and me. We thought they didn't have any life at all outside of their research, so we asked the Institute's director to arrange something...\n...Petrichor's quite boring, but the scenery is quite nice, since you can see the great waterfall. I brought a Kamera from the Institute to take photos for them. I hope there are more outings like this one in the future so I can take more photos of his sister especially. After all, Alain is always working and can't be with his sister as she grows up, so these photos will come in handy later when he regrets not spending much time with her. Then he'll be able to see how she was at different times, and it won't sting so much! If only my family had enough money for a Kamera and things didn't go wrong, I'm sure my mom would have taken lots of photos of me... Rene and Jakob like Alain's sister a lot, too. When the four of them hang out, she sometimes acts like an older sister to them, despite being the youngest, it's a really interesting dynamic...\n...Seems to be interested in the ruins and the stone statues here. Rene also mentioned something about a troupe and seals... Even though we went out there to have a bit of fun for once, they were still thinking about research...\nNo obvious symptoms.\n...\nTook the day off.\n...\n...Alain's sister came to see me with Jakob. Alain and Rene couldn't make it, because their experiment is at a critical stage. They didn't have to tell me any of that though, after all, with my limited abilities, that I was able to help at all is already fulfilling!\n...\nI heard that Alain and the Institute's director came to see me (separately)! while I was unconscious. I feel bad that they came all this way for nothing, I wasn't even awake... Still taking take off, but I hope to go back and help them again soon.\n...\n...I found out that they were graduates from the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and that made me really happy. They talked about the director and the vice director, as well as their adventures, and it made me feel like a kid again. The only detail that didn't make sense was the cake the vice director made, because it felt like punishment when we had it...\n...After the disaster, I lost contact with pretty much all my friends. I'm so happy that they were able to find each other again. I wonder how my friends are doing. They're probably trying to rebuild the Narzissenkreuz Institute! Next time I'll go check it out...\n...Talked about the thinking machine again. I had an idea about making a thinking Kamera, so that it would take photos of those precious to him while he's busy. He thought it was kind of pointless, but that it had security and surveillance applications...\n...\n...They did it! The light bulb came on! I was lucky to have recovered in time to witness this historical moment... It's quite a pity, but I hope Rene and Jakob will make the breakthroughs of their own in their own research topics! Ah, I also hope they get better assistants than me!\nNo clear symptoms.\n...\nTook the day off.\n...\nThere were several visits while I was unconscious. It's a shame, all I could do is read the letters they left behind. Jakob left me a note, inviting me to his and Rene's lab. There's something they want to talk to me about.\nI hope I can get out of bed soon.\n...\nAnn brought flowers for me, but they had already wilted by the time I woke up.\nTook the day off.\n...\nI was able to get out of bed today.\nThis is where I first met Alain. For a time afterwards, my first time standing here I documented the experimental procedures and phenomena based on his oral descriptions. He was trying to start up the machinery below in an ill-fitting lab coat. Rene and Jakob later entered through that door, and Alain would temporarily forget to act the young genius, and rush towards them like an energetic kid.\nI found myself witness to the first successful controlled annihilation reaction. The brilliant light cast a deep, dark shadow and I believe history was made in that moment. Can someone like me, so excited I knocked over the ink bottle, play a role in such a historical event?\nBehind the locked door on the other side is Rene and Jakob's lab. It seems access was limited due to the dangerous nature of their research. They are destined to become towering figures in history.\nI guess Alain moved to another lab. Based on his plan, once the energy problems was solved, he would study kinematics. I'll go greet him later. I wonder how Ann is doing now? I wonder what kind of beautiful woman she will grow up to be?\nI'll stop writing here. I don't have much time left.\nI hope everything goes well."

There's no way old-fashioned clockwork meka can withstand such power output. Even young geniuses must stumble now and then...\n...\n...The thought of using this sort of unstable energy source is impressive. Though we have long observed these unique energies in Fontaine's atmosphere, water, and organisms, it has always been regarded as a latent threat, rather than a potential resource...\n...\n...Aren't there a few young geniuses too many nowadays? The director is pleased, sure, but won't someone spare a thought for us ordinary people? I mean, not all of us are as simpleminded as Scherbius...\n...\n...It received a very high rating. If the patent were to be granted, the potential financial gain would be considerable. However, I decided to decline the opportunity, because the machine was practically all Guillotin's work, and I can take no credit there. My family was quite angry about it, but as an engineer, one must have at least a little dignity and self-awareness...\n...Still making improvements, and output efficiency has increased...\n...\n...Seems to have been specially recruited. That's good. Had he continued that line of research, who knows what horrors he might have unleashed...\n...\n...At this stage, we have to pull out. The director says everyone will be given a position and research resources after reconstruction, but I'm afraid if it were me, I would use this as an excuse for a major shake-up. People like me won't get recalled anyway. Never mind. I've been pretty happy these past few days, I guess I'll consider it my retirement. I'll go to the city and open a small workshop, repairing watches for folks, Kameras too. Right, I'll see if I can make a waterproof clock.

            "text": "...\nOceanids are beautiful creatures nurtured by the land of Fontaine. According to legend, the gentle Egeria shed the first tear, from which the first Oceanid was born. Some say that Egeria felt great sympathy for dragons, and others say she felt great sadness over the eventual fate of humanity. Now, all that we have left is a metaphorical representation whose true meaning remains unclear: \"The lizard's bones dissolved into mud, from which swans emerged.\"\nThe newborn Oceanid was bestowed with the task of comprehending all forms of life: to seek an understanding of the diverse array of species and to love every creature. It emerged from the sea of life, possessing the power of metamorphosis. Egeria wished it to use this power to etch the essence of living creatures into its being and it gradually developed a yearning for life. Once it gained enough understanding of humanity, it shed its first tear upon the earth. We have used \"she\" to refer to the first and her lineage ever since.\nThis is the origin of Oceanids.\n(A small addendum: Perhaps you believe that this kind of document has no scientific value, asserting that physical evidence and records suggest that the origin of Oceanids predates Egeria and the even earlier realm of Remuria, and you reckon that only Evolutionary Diversity of Forest Pigs: Field Tracking Research on Geographically Distinct Forms counts as genuine research. So, I have a question for you: Do you dare to explore our own origins? The gods unleash thunder in anger, and goddesses cry oceans in sorrow — these things are real.)\n...\nOceanids display considerable disparities in cognitive capacity, partially due to differences in lifespan resulting in very different levels of experience and knowledge regarding the world, but substantial individual variation in the Oceanids themselves also contributes to this phenomenon. Some Oceanids are simply too obtuse to complete tasks related to the continent's water systems and are thus confined to Fontaine, where they assist in soothing human emotions.\n...\nThe increase in the number of Oceanids (we have previously considered breeding, proliferation, and reproduction, but none are suitable terms) does not require any pairing off or matchmaking. After gaining sufficient understanding and emotion, they approach the Hydro Archon or an elder for permission to claim... um, a thing, which results in their division into little Oceanids.\nThis thing is highly abstract, and in order to make its name more comprehensible to humans, we refer to it as a \"Helixsplit.\" However, what it is exactly remains unknown. Some believe it could be a drop of pure water essence, nurtured by the emotions and intelligence of the parent, eventually giving rise to life. Others speculate that it might be a single sound, a name, possibly even a forbidden utterance, capable of stirring the cycle of elemental forces and drawing on the desire that doesn't exist with the pure water bodies of Oceanids, allowing new life to be attracted into the world. Still, others propose that it serves as a permit, granting permission for the dreams and desires within Oceanids to be bestowed with a new name — much like the names of childhood dreams throughout the ages.\nHowever, this is a story between Oceanids, and humans have no hope to know it.\n...\nThe propagation of all Oceanids needs to be officially registered. If something were to happen to Egeria (No disrespect intended— may she keep some blessings for herself), the Oceanid elders will also ensure the continuation of their species. But in the event of a more calamitous occurrence, what will happen to the Oceanids?"
