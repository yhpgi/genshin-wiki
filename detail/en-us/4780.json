The beating heart that commanded this Primordial Sea of blood was the first Hydro Dragon. Each time that heart pulsed, all life would arise and give it praise.\nWhen that first heart was removed, the envoy of Celestia, the leader upon whose shoulders lay the duty to create life, came to the great primeval sea, and there she created another heart, Egeria. That heart had like nobility unto a dragon, but lacked its outer form, and had the majesty of a god, yet was bereft of any divine duty. And though it was created by a ruler of humans, its substance and essence were all original matter from this world, entirely without outside elements. She was the tears that flowed into the primordial sea, seeking communication and understanding, a pursuit which caused her to weep. And it was due to this compassion that she committed all the sins that all beings of pure water must beware."

He was predicted to build a prosperous nation and bring civilization and justice to people, but in the end, that very justice would be their downfall. The God King could not abide the dark future foretold, and he decided to find Egeria, imprisoned in Fontemer. In the deepest depths of the waters, the abode of eternal night, the illustrious king learned all the secrets of the Mistress of Many Waters. Egeria told Remus that she had once committed an unforgivable sin, and the resulting curse was also irrevocable. In the end, Remus took the Pure Grail with him on the journey. He promised Egeria to create a world free from the shackles of providence.\nIn an attempt to escape fate, Remus created imperishable bodies of bronze and stone for his people with blood from insoluble Ichor so that time could not destroy them. The God King created a great Symphony so that every free person could control their own destinies. To bring civilization to the northern \"barbarians,\" Remurian Harmosts led armies of golems to conquer the peoples of the High Sea, but Egeria's followers, the Lochknights, refused to submit. They swore to protect the spirits of pure springs (Oceanids) and other knights from the warriors of Remus. Their main goal was to find the Pure Grail to atone for the original sin and release Egeria from the shackles of confinement.\nOne legend says that when sin tempted the City of Eternity to its fall, the Lochknights faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known. But in the end, the heartfelt longing of the people reached the heavens. Then, thanks to their pure hearts and the Pure Grail obtained through countless sacrifices, the Mistress of Many Waters was freed from imprisonment and restored.\nAnother legend says that when sin tempted the City of Eternity to its fall, a singer named Erinnyes faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known. Yet, she remained unable to find that Pure Grail. But it was the heavens who chose the Mistress of Many Waters, commanding her to return from her primeval prison to take over from the golden king and rule the sea-ruins."

In honor of the Lochknights' feat, who witnessed the return of Egeria, the Fontinalia Festival was declared.\nPreviously, during the reign of Egeria, criminals were expelled to the desert, but some began to ask Egeria for forgiveness, and the merciful Mistress of Many Waters allowed them to guard the secret located in the sea. This is how the Fortress of Meropide came to be. This secret was a passage to the Primordial Sea, which, according to prophecy, was supposed to destroy Fontaine. Over time, the community of criminals grew, and many forgot about the original goal, but the passage to the Primordial Sea remained a forbidden zone.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Now, all that we have left is a metaphorical representation whose true meaning remains unclear: <color=#ffffffd9>\"The lizard's bones dissolved into mud, from which swans emerged.\"</color> The newborn Oceanid was bestowed with the task of comprehending all forms of life: to seek an understanding of the diverse array of species and to love every creature. She emerged from the sea of life, possessing the power of metamorphosis. Egeria wished her to use this power to etch the essence of living creatures into her being and she gradually developed a yearning for life. Once it gained enough understanding of humanity, she shed its first tear upon the earth. Oceanids expressed love by merging water bodies together. This way, many minds could coexist without division.\nThe Oceanids were Egeria's familiars. She once sent them to live in rivers, streams, and ponds all over the continent, and almost all of them were spies for Fontaine. The Mistress of Many Waters wished to connect everyone in the world in much the same way as all water is connected.\nOceanids displayed considerable disparities in cognitive capacity, partially due to differences in lifespan resulting in very different levels of experience and knowledge regarding the world, but substantial individual variation in the Oceanids themselves also contributes to this phenomenon. Some Oceanids were simply too obtuse to complete tasks related to the continent's water systems and are thus confined to Fontaine, where they assist in soothing human emotions.\nAfter the death of Egeria, many Oceanids lost contact with Fontaine. They did not recognize the new Hydro Archon and desired only to keep the dreams of yesteryear alive. Many Oceanids made pilgrimages across the sultry Sumeru Desert to reach Harvisptokhm and see their goddess."

If the theft of the Primordial Sea's might was Fontaine's \"original sin,\" the descent of Fontainians as humans and their right to exist in this world would be Fontaine's \"original justice.\" \"Existence\" was Egeria's justice, and Focalors continued this principle. Defying the prophecy and ensuring that Fontaine's people shall live on — that should be the authority enthroned over all others.\nFocalors pondered for a long time how to counter the prophecy and found the only possible answer: it was necessary to deceive the heavenly principles during the fulfillment of the prophecy. After becoming an Archon, Focalors separated her newfound divinity from her body and spirit, creating Furina. While Furina ruled Fontaine, Focalors accumulated energy to deceive the heavenly principles. 500 years later, when the prophecy began to come true, Focalors was able to use all this energy to destroy her divine part and, accordingly, destroy the throne of Hydro Archon, returning Hydro authority to the Dragon Sovereign Neuvillette. After gaining his full power, he forgave the Fontainians their original sin and turned them into real people.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
