Wait, no. Who are you?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? You can't have forgotten us already! We're Traveler and Paimon!\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nTraveler and Paimon... I have indeed heard tell of these names, but I could've sworn I heard them in a dream!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... But you were definitely awake then, Este! Also, while we were below, didn't we even see...\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\n*sigh* I dreamed that everyone in town was petrified, turned into statues of stone, leaving me utterly helpless and alone.\nUntil finally, two brave heroes came and shouldered the burden of rescuing everyone... Could it be, that it was no dream at all?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Maybe, maybe not.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That's not important.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah. After all, everyone's back to normal now, aren't they?\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nBut it seems as though everyone had some very strange dreams indeed. Just what happened? Could we all have been hypnotized en masse?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIt would take us ages to explain it all properly... Just forget about the hypnosis thing for now!\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nOh? Speaking of hypnosis, you two even brought over a cat! It looks quite intelligent.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>He's even smarter than he looks.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAnd moreover, he's our companion! But unfortunately, we can't take him with us on our journey...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>He's our companion.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's true, but we still can't take him with us on our journey...\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nWell now, isn't that a coincidence? Our club just happens to have an open bed for cats available. It's been unoccupied ever since that hypnosis researcher went a-traveling and took his cat with him.\nIf you two don't mind, leave him here with us. We'll take care of him.\nThough I can't quite put my finger on it, I feel like we're bound up together, almost as if by fate. I'll help you take very good care of him indeed.\nThe cattery is on the other side of the building. Just walk over and you'll see it.\nOptional Dialogue: Speak to Este\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nThe cattery is on the other side of the building. Just walk over and you'll see it.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Bring Osse to the cattery</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, this'll be your home from now on, Osse!\n<color=#ffffff>Osse:</color>\nMeeeow?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nStill, it feels a bit weird. Cassiodor should've already left here, right? So who is Osse now?\nIs it the original cat that hadn't been indwelt by Cassiodor, or is it the Monsieur Os that shared all those adventures with us...? Ugh, Paimon's brain is cramping up.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Paimon, you're really not suited to thinking about stuff like this.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nPaimon doesn't get it at all...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>\"Osse\" is \"Osse.\"</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThough Paimon still doesn't get it, it does make a certain kind of sense...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAnyway, we've found a new home for Osse now, too! If we've got time, maybe we can come play with him!\n<color=#ffffff>Osse:</color>\nMeow meow!"
