They began to imitate the victors, and eventually, this gave rise to a line of Vishaps who were indistinguishable from humans except for their pupils. These\ninfiltrated Enkanomiya and took over many high-ranking positions. Tsumi lived among the Vishaps since childhood and considered herself one of them. She had nothing but an unusual medallion and a couple of boxes of books. Thanks to the books, she learned human writing and speech, but she had no opportunity to talk to people and find out what the books were talking about. For many years, they lived in the dark until one day the Traveler descended to Enkanomiya to find the Bloodbranch Coral of Watatsumi Omikami and perform a ritual on Watatsumi Island. Such corals kept the dragons of the deep under the tower in the Dainichi Mikoshi at bay, and a protective barrier surrounded the tower itself. To take the coral, the Traveler removed the barrier and restarted the artificial sun, bringing light to Enkanomiya and disturbing the Vishaps. Ever since the first war, light meant the presence of humans to the dragons, so they avoided it."

This phenomenon is an expansion of the habitat of the Bathysmal Vishaps and means that the primordial elemental power of the three worlds is increasing. The Holy Soil makes the soil infertile and attacks agriculture. During the ritual, the Divine Priestess noticed that the phenomenon did not disappear, but only stopped. At this time, Tsumi allied with Enjou, a member of the Abyss Order. She wanted to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi so that darkness would reign in Enkanomiya and the Vishaps could rescue their captive kin. Enjou promised to plunge Enkanomiya into darkness, and in return, the Vishaps would allow the Abyss Order safe passage through their territory and help in restoring the Towers of Void. The Vishaps did not know that the darkness of the Abyss was a terrible poison for elemental beings, so they agreed to the deal, but Enjou betrayed them. He rebuilt the towers at the corners of Enkanomiya's border and then used them to spread the energy of the Abyss, which brought great torment to the Vishaps."

The Divine Priestess of Sangonomiya asked the Traveler to help cleanse Enkanomiya of the darkness and gave them a piece of the medallion in case they had to make a choice. Tsumi donned a mask that hid her snake eyes and pretended to be the Priestess of Sangonomiya to help the wounded. She teamed up with the Traveler to take revenge on Enjou. Tsumi gave the Traveler a special Bokuso Box that could dispel the darkness that had enveloped Enkanomiya so that she could use the power of the Dainichi Mikoshi to create darkness to protect the Vishaps. Enjou revealed Tsumi's true motives to the Traveler and gave them a medallion similar to the one the Divine Priestess gave as a parting gift. He also helped them direct the light and dispel the darkness in the Dainichi Mikoshi using the mechanisms he left near the Tower of Void."

If Tsumi had wished for it, the tower would have collapsed before her. With a single thought, as if with a snap of the fingers, the source of the great suffering of the Vishaps would have collapsed. But Tsumi could not do this. When the Traveler gave her the two pieces of the medallion at their meeting, Tsumi combined them with her own, and they formed a medallion in the shape of three entwined snakes. This relic belonged to the beginning of the era when Watatsumi Omikami reorganized the court and reformed Enkanomiya. The three pendants were given to the Dainichi Mikoshi, the Sangonomiya line, and the Vassals of Watatsumi, Orobashi's familiars. The original intention was that the common folk, the officials, and the divine vassals would all hold each other accountable. Vassals of Watatsumi typically took on a half-human, half-snake form, symbolizing that they were the familiars of the serpent god. Over time, the vassals gradually became identical to humans — all except for the pupils of their eyes, and the Vishap-people and Reptilians were just a fantasy. The Watatsumi Omikami exhausted its power to create Watatsumi Island, and after that, it grew weaker and weaker. No more Vassals of Watatsumi were born after that. However, there is a mention in the records of the last of the Vassals, who was supposed to be the link between the dragons and humans. When she was just an infant girl, she and her guardian shrine maiden were attacked by Vishaps at the border of Enkanomiya. Many believed that she died, while others thought that the Vishaps raised her. The fragment of Tsumi's medallion perfectly matched the fragments from Sangonomiya and Dainichi Mikoshi only because she was a Vassal of Watatsumi. She still did not want to accept it and chose the Vishaps."
