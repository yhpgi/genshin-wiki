Four years prior, after finally beheading Demon King Danjouchuu, the Tai-Shogun's own reign of terror began.\nIt was in this time and place that our free and unrestrained swordmaster wandered the land.\nHis name was Bitchuu Kyuubei, and he was known to the people as Shinkurou, the vigilante.\nBitchuu Kyuubei was not a ronin as such. It is said that he was once the most trusted strategist for His Excellency the Tai-Shogun, until one day he was framed by a rival. Given the Shogun's paranoid nature, this left him with no choice but to flee the Shogunate and escape into the wilderness.\nToday, Shinkurou was standing on a mountainside gazing into the distance. But what was the object of his gaze?\nWas it the vast expanse of open fields? No.\nWas it the mountain range in the distance? No.\nWas it the road stretching out ahead of him? Yes! Although, that's not the full story.\nSo. What was the object of Shinkurou's gaze, exactly...?\nThe farmers who had paid the swordsman in rice for his services cowered in fear, too afraid to ask.\nIt seems that only the silent swordsman himself knew the answer to this question."
