Once accustomed to life there, they could no longer feel comfortable in the overworld. Some left after serving their sentences, while others stayed, finding idle positions and letting their souls fade away with ancient secrets. The number of those who joined the order and lived underwater gradually grew, while those who took the oath with understanding and knowledge of the teachings steadily diminished. After many centuries, few remembered the original reason for the Fortress's founding. Now, it is seen as an integral part of Fontainian society, and a gathering place for exiles.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "<color=#ffffff73>The Fortress is an underwater stronghold with a measure of autonomy and self-governance from Fontaine's legal systems. Despite being autonomous, it serves as a prison for those who have stood trial and been sentenced. Different people of different backgrounds come here for all kinds of reasons. They are able to live peaceful, regimented lives, free from fear — no matter what they've gone through.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>Credit Coupons serve the role of currency in the Fortress and can fulfill desires, grant power, and even alter destiny. Inside the fortress, everyone is given a chance at a fresh start, regardless of their previous wealth or status. It's a place where everyone begins anew, earning their coupons from scratch. This system represents genuine fairness and justice, offering a chance at a better life. Credit Coupons were created for the Fortress as it was seen as a \"nation within a nation\" and free from divine intervention. They serve as an experiment to prohibit the power of the Gods from intervening or embellishing the power of the wealthy over the poor. Even though the Fortress of Meropide is independent from Fontaine's court system, there are all kinds of mechanical products for official use, and some essential goods that have to be obtained from the overworld, as such, Neuvillette, the Iudex of Fontaine, and Wriothesley stay in touch. Additionally, the Fortress is currently the largest manufacturer of Fontaine's clockwork meka.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>On the lowest level of the Fortress of Meropide, there's the Geode Mine, whose shaft is filled with Arkhium crystal and is patrolled by Flying Energy Thieves. The Flying Energy Thief is a trial product that has not undergone internal or peer review. It pursues any entity carrying an energy storage device and disables the said device. Loss of control or explosions occurring during the trial product's operation are considered unfortunate accidents for which the manufacturer is not liable. All work related to the Shaft has been suspended, and the connecting paths have been sealed. No one comes there due to its closure. If someone requires one of the connecting paths to be opened for official Fortress business, they must operate the drive valve only under the supervision of a technical expert to prevent accidents.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The Pankration Ring is the most popular form of entertainment in the Fortress of Meropide. Though the rules state that it is \"Pankration,\" and thus is hand-to-hand combat, \"using other handheld weapons to fight others\" would not be considered a rule violation. As long as special conditions are met, whether Sternshield Crab or a clockwork meka, all can stand on the stage of the Pankration Ring. The winning team will receive Credit Coupons as well as a fantastic Fonta Trophy. When shown at the Fontaine Research Institute, the winner is able to drink all the Fonta they would like, for free. Once, the institute wanted to test their new red Fonta taste, and even offered to sponsor the Pankration tournament so they could push their new product, but the Duke refused to even entertain the idea. The institute representatives are still trying to promote their drink, thus the \"hidden rule\" of the Pankration Ring appeared: If someone tries to support both boxers at the same time, they'll receive a package the next morning, which contains a strange blood-colored liquid.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Vautrin, a leader of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, worked with a Melusine named Carole to foster human-Melusine collaboration. For his continued dedication for five years, and for keeping peace in the Court of Fontaine, he and Carole were awarded a Medal of Peace crafted by Neuvillette himself. This act was a small step forward in helping Melusines gain the trust of humans. When Carole was framed for murder, Vautrin executed those responsible. At his trial, Neuvillette found him guilty of abusing his authority. Though Vautrin appeared outraged, this was an act to showcase Neuvillette's impartiality and fairness, strengthening his and the Melusines' place in Fontainian society. After being sent to the Fortress of Meropide, Vautrin established the Mutual Aid Network, which used a design similar to his Medal of Peace as their badge for the next 400 years. The Network encourages members to do what they are able, including but not limited to cleaning, exercising, tutoring, and studying. It is hoped that all Mutual Aid Network members will, during their time in the Fortress of Meropide, encourage each other, support each other, and welcome the future together.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

He was sent there as a teenager after he was convicted of killing his foster parents out of revenge for their exploitative foster home scheme. While a prisoner at the Fortress for some time, he realized that inmates could use Coupons for illicit activities like assassinations and drugs. As part of a plan to end this, Wriothesley earned more Coupons than all the other inmates combined. This accumulated wealth made him a man of high repute amongst his fellow inmates, but disapproving of this, the then administrator erased his account entirely. Wriothesley challenged the administrator to a duel and when the day of the duel came, the administrator fled. The duel also happened to be scheduled on Wriothesley's release date, and as the administrator was nowhere to be found, there was no one available to sign his exit papers. He proceeded to walk into the office in the middle of the Fortress and took over all relevant duties. He then enacted several reforms to improve life within the prison. Prior to the Duke, even a basic necessity like water required Credit Coupons. Newly admitted inmates had to work without food until they earned enough coupons to eat. However, after Wriothesley became the administrator, a new policy was implemented: everyone receives a daily meal, regardless of their background or work status. This ensured that nobody goes hungry within the fortress.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>Wriothesley recently was awarded the honorary title of \"Duke\" in Fontaine, only those who have made significant contributions to the nation have been conferred this title, it's incredibly rare. Many people, like Navia's father, Callas, view Fontaine's various titles as hollow; but even the former head of Spina di Rosula acknowledged that Duke Wriothesley is far more worldly than he seems.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Dougier was the head and founder of the Beret Society, who stated his mission was to help everyone turn over a new leaf, so they would no longer have to lead such gloomy existences. Wriothesley approved Dougier's application for the Beret Society believing it to be a group filled with model prisoners and a great place for those who wish to turn things around. Funded by members' donated goods and Credit Coupons, the society gathered near the Coupon Cafeteria and offered drinks, snacks, books, and other resources to prisoners. They also hosted popular activities and seminars, providing an outlet for prisoners to relax.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The society members wore berets as a visible identifier and symbol of community pride. Dougier believed that if the members felt joy and pride from being a part of the group, then the hats would become a point of pride for them as well. The berets represented everything the group was believed to work toward — optimism, community, hard work, and the desire to create a new life. The berets also served to symbolize \"model citizens\" and help recruit new members.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>Eventually, with subtle hints, Wriothesley realized that something was off about the Beret Society. After some investigation, it was found that the berets concealed a thorn filled with Aqua Doloris, a dark liquid that induced fear when injected into members' brains. Dougier punished and tortured those who broke the society's true rules with this liquid. Breaking a rule resulted in \"censure,\" where the thorn injected Aqua Doloris into the member's head, inducing fear as a reminder of Dougier's authority. More severe, unmentioned punishments existed for greater infractions. He had also amassed an \"army\" of Gardemeks which he planned to use to overthrow Wriothesley. Dougier's plans were eventually thwarted, leading to his apprehension and the disbandment of the society.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "<color=#ffffff73>When the Traveler visited Fontaine, the city was experiencing a series of disappearances, and authorities had accused Childe, eleventh of the Fatui Harbingers, of being the culprit. Despite the actual culprit having already been exposed and sentenced during the trial, Childe was imprisoned at the Fortress of Meropide after being found guilty by the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, a large mechanical scale located in the Court of Fontaine's Opera Epiclese which was created by the Hydro Archon Focalors. The Oratrice delivered precise judgments, and regardless of the Chief Justice's, Neuvillette, opinion during the trial, the Oratrice held the final verdict. After a period of time, Childe disappeared.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>Another Fatui Harbinger, The Knave, soon sought a diplomatic meeting with Furina which Neuvillette also attended. During the meeting,</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>requested Childe be turned over to Snezhnaya, citing their diplomatic roles and responsibilities. However, since the trial concluded, Fontaine saw the case as settled, and Neuvillette denied The Knave's request. The Harbinger then proposed visiting the Fortress of Meropide to check on Childe, but Neuvillette explained the Fortress of Meropide falls outside the court's jurisdiction and offered an alternative proposal. As Childe has vanished from prison, with no sightings reported outside, he proposed delegating someone else to investigate, which she reluctantly accepted.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The Traveler and Paimon made an agreement with Neuvillette to investigate Childe's disappearance under the guise of being prisoners in order to gather information on the Harbinger's whereabouts. The Fatui had sent their own infiltrators as informants to both the prisoners and guards, but they vanished. Subsequently, Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet were dispatched to infiltrate the fortress and gather intelligence. The \"Father\" of their House, The Knave, instructed them to conduct an investigation into the secret the Fortress of Meropide was hiding. The House of the Hearth had been investigating for a very long time, trying to uncover the mystery, when all of their informants, including the ones that had infiltrated the guards, suddenly vanished. Additionally, Arlecchino had somehow managed to confirm that Focalors did not possess Hydro Gnosis. It was this information that led them to suspect that Fontaine's Gnosis might be in the Fortress of Meropide, and related to that \"secret.\" The Knave used the situation with Childe as a pretext to negotiate with two high-ranking officials in the Court of Fontaine. Childe was almost like a bargaining chip for her.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>During their investigation, Lyney uncovered the fact that the Fortress of Meropide has a \"forbidden zone\" which was confirmed by the guards. After some persuasion, the Duke of the Fortress, Wriothesley, agreed to escort the Traveler and Paimon into the forbidden zone. They arrived at one of the three giant isolation gates, where only Wriothesley was allowed inside. The concentration of the Primordial Sea in the waters surrounding the Fortress of Meropide had started to rise, and the \"forbidden zone\" contained a massive sluice gate that was holding back the Primordial Sea.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The rise of the Primordial Sea was especially concerning due to a prophecy circulating throughout Fontaine that said that every person in Fontaine was born with \"sin,\" and one day, the water levels in Fontaine would rise causing the sinful people to slowly drown.</color> <color=#ffffffd9>\"In the end, the people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne.\"</color> <color=#ffffff73>Later it was revealed that Childe's disappearance was linked to a mysterious voice he heard while in the Fortress of Meropide. Following this voice, Childe escaped the Fortress and ended up in the Primordial Sea where he lost consciousness. He awoke with a massive narwhal swimming before him. He proceeded to battle with the Narwhal and inadvertently delayed the prophecy from coming true. In an attempt to save people should the prophecy come true, Wriothesley recruited Jurieu and Lourvine to help build a gargantuan ship which was also kept at the Fortress. According to the legend, the Remurian God King, Remus, came to Fontaine after being inspired by divine revelation and found the seer Sybilla, who had taken on the form of a Golden Bee. Taking Sybilla with him and riding on a huge ship, the Fortuna, he created his nation above the surging waves. Wriothesley was inspired by the legendary Fortuna and began constructing a boat when he suspected the Primordial Sea lay beyond the gate. When the Prophecy of Fontaine came to fruition, the Duke deployed the gargantuan ship, The Wingalet, to help with rescue operations. Once the waters receded, the ship returned to the prison and was placed in storage, garnering significant media attention and intriguing several researchers.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Estienne created Coupon Millionaire so those who want to go outside could sign up for the opportunity. Noailles, another guard, is not as lenient as Estienne and does not find Estienne's methods suitable. He believes as a guard, Estienne should use his powers to make people obey, instead of playing this game with them.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The group of players consisted of Genevieve, who was partnered with Poiret, Rave, and Darcy. One of the people in the group playing the game was a young girl named Lanoire. Curious as to how a young girl could be a criminal at the Fortress, the Traveler and Paimon began to speak with her to get some answers. Throughout their conversation, Lanoire tells them about her friend Cater. From Cater, also referred to as Caterpillar, they learned Lanoire was born within the Fortress. Agnes, her mother, was plagued by a chronic illness and passed away before being able to submit documents to provide Lanoire proof of identity. She was the one who'd have needed to start the process to send Lanoire away from the Fortress but passed away some time ago before being able to do so. Afterwards, Estienne had asked Cater to look after her. A safe way to get Lanoire out of the Fortress of Meropide was to win the game of Coupon Millionaire, but doing so required a lot of Coupons. Caterpillar, the Traveler, and Paimon worked together to win Coupon Millionaire so that Lanoire had the chance to get back to her family once outside the Fortress. When the other team had almost won, it turned out that Caterpillar, who had been in the Fortress for about 400 years, had collected a million coupons. Together with Estienne, the Traveler, Paimon, Lanoir, and Caterpillar got out of the Fortress.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>When Lanoire saw the outside world for the first time, she compared the continent of Teyvat to the Fortress of Meropide, assuming Teyvat must be enormous since she couldn't see any walls. Estienne wanted to let Lanoire go, and as the group planned to find Lanoire's family, Noailles confronted them, questioning their intentions and their presence with Lanoire. Estienne defended their actions, claiming he was correcting the mistake of Lanoire and Caterpillar's imprisonment due to missing paperwork. However, Noailles insisted they were still criminals.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>When he saw the real appearance of Caterpillar — a hilichurl — he considered him a monster and wanted to destroy him and lock the rest in prison. Thanks to the help of Estienne and another guard, Lanoire and Caterpillar managed to leave the Fortress through the shaft of the Geode Mine, and Lanoire went to her grandfather, Earnshaw, who did not even know about her existence.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
