Putting the tune inscribed upon the shattered rubble back together, it appears to be a small sliver of a grander musical movement.</p><p>People once believed that the song of eternal happiness and harmony would resound throughout the world till the end of all destinies. But harmonies can be changed. When the rebellious God King fell from his throne, the imperishable capital was reduced to refuse and rubble — for who, then, shall the lyre in the hands of a legion-less commander play?</p>",
