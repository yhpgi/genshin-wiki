When gliding in the air, they can consume Phlogiston to climb higher, accelerate their glide, or <color=#ffe14b>Tap</color> to perform a rolling dash. At this time, they can also <color=#ffe14b>Hold</color> to launch a Plunging Attack, which can be canceled mid-duration by releasing, returning to the gliding state.
