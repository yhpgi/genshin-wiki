You had no answers.\nThus, you began a lonely journey, seeking the deity that you had once laid eyes upon...\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 2</color>\nAfter that, you met Paimon, and wandered together for some time.\nYou learned that this world has seven deities who rule the seven nations as the Seven Archons.\nYour first stop was the free city of wine and song, Mondstadt, a city built by the Anemo Archon.\nAs you stepped into Mondstadt as an outlander, it was, as the other nations were, beset on both sides by non-human and human threats.\nThe non-human threat was comprised of the confederacy known as the Abyss Order.\nThe human threat, on the other hand stemmed, from the ambition of the Tsaritsa, god of Snezhnaya.\nThe Abyss Order had corrupted an ally of the Anemo Archon, the Dragon of the East of the Four Winds of Mondstadt.\nThe envoys of Snezhnaya, for their part, used this opposition to the Abyss as an excuse to put pressure on Mondstadt.\nThese threats from without and within caused the return of the Anemo Archon, who took on the form of a bard and joined you in your journey to save the dragon.\nYet there was something then that you did not see — for as the dragon fell to the Abyss, a certain figure had been reflected in its eyes...\nThe one who rules the Abyss.\nHe/She had once traveled with you, and you had once crossed many worlds together.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 3</color>\nThough you made no promises, though it was an \"agreement\" the other party made one-sidedly,\nYou nonetheless set out on a sojourn across the Seven Nations to reach \"the journey's end.\"\nIt would be a stretch to call this a pleasant path — as your feet took you forward, you witnessed and were pulled into the crises each nation faced...\nPerhaps this is no coincidence. Perhaps some tremendous tremor deeper beneath the world is to blame for the waves of catastrophe.\nThe Tsaritsa's plan to collect the Gnoses persists apace, while the terrifying force corrupting the world awaits opportunities to strike.\nAnd the Abyss Order, the organization led by your own flesh and blood...\nFrom the Loom of Fate operational launch to the Atlas of the New World's completion, you know deep down that their actions are changing the fate of this world.\nAs you gradually understand said world, you have also come to understand the things your sister/brother...\nBut this has not made your journey any easier, nor your footsteps lighter. That was not what you expected at first."

Still, we don't know for sure if she/he's the highest-ranking leader in the organization.\nAlso, your sister/brother said that she/he wants to \"engulf the thrones\" and go to \"war with destiny.\" What the heck does that mean? ...Could it be that she/he wants to destroy The Seven and the seven nations?\nNext thing... turns out the Abyss Order monsters are really what the people of Khaenri'ah turned into after their nation was destroyed. This story is just plain terrifying!\nAnd Dain is from Khaenri'ah, too! He witnessed its destruction 500 years ago. But... he didn't turn into a monster, and now he's fighting the Abyss Order...\nSo that's why your sister/brother said that Dain is her/his enemy, right?\nBut... If the monsters of the Abyss are the same people that Dain protected all those years ago, then why is he enemies with the Abyss Order now?\nAlso, how come... after all this time we've spent searching for your sister/brother, it turns out she/he's on the side of the Abyss. What's up with that?"
