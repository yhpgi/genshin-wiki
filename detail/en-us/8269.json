From Inazuma, the game spread throughout Teyvat and won the hearts of thousands of fans. One day in Mondstadt, the Traveler and Paimon met Sucrose, an assistant to the chief alchemist of the Knights of Favonius, who had received a package from a wandering Sumeru scholar with whom she worked. She had once seen some unusual cards on her colleague Timaeus, so she asked the scholar for advice. In gratitude for her help with the research, he sent her a set of Genius Invokation TCG cards, among which was even a card with an image of Sucrose herself. Since neither Sucrose, nor the Traveler, nor Paimon had ever played the game, they went to The Cat's Tail tavern, where players often gathered. When the number of visitors coming to play cards increased, the owner of the tavern, Margaret, assigned a special employee to help the players. The employee turned out to be a black cat named Prince, whom the Traveler and Paimon had once helped search for. A special assistant was assigned to \"translate\" Prince's speech, claiming that after playing Genius Invokation TCG, he could fully understand the animal."

She gave the Traveler and Sucrose a card of \"Diluc,\" a wine tycoon of Mondstadt, which had recently been left at the tavern by Diluc's adopted brother, Kaeya. Diluc was surprised to see a card with his image and decided to talk to his brother about it. After learning the rules of the game and winning a duel with Sucrose, the Traveler received a Casket of Tomes from Margaret, a box for storing cards that picks up signals from other boxes nearby, helping to find opponents. After defeating a Knight of Favonius, Prince assigned the Traveler a special opponent, Fischl, whose defeat would allow them to become a certified card player. By defeating the Prinzessin der Verurteilung in equal combat, the Traveler received the Fischl card, the TCG Player's Handbook, and the ability to purchase various goods related to Genius Invokation TCG from the tavern.\nWhen the game became so popular that all of Teyvat started playing it, the spirit of the teapot, Tubby, created a special subspace where players from all over the world could play with each other without having to travel to other countries.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

When the Traveler and Paimon arrived in Mondstadt, the tournament was already nearing its finale, so they were unable to participate, but in addition to the official competition, players organized their own unofficial tournaments with no time limit for submitting applications. When the Traveler and Paimon went to Diona at The Cat's Tail tavern, they noticed an unusual Youkai from Inazuma next to the girl, a Komaniya Express courier, Kirara. And after meeting Diona and the owner of the tavern, when they were heading to the tournament site, they were introduced to a journalist from Fontaine, Charlotte, who came to cover each tournament of the King of Invokations Grand Prix.

So, after the deal, the surprised man wanted to check if the Mora was real and was then attacked. After telling everything to the Knights of Favonius and realizing that there was some secret behind the card backs, Charlotte, the Traveler, and Paimon went to Liyue Harbor, where the next finals were to be held. As they left the tournament, they saw a poster for the tournament, which featured the creators of Genius Invokation TCG, but no one knew their identities, addresses, or other information."

In the semi-finals, the Archon lost to Miko. The second finalist was the High Priestess Sangonomiya Kokomi, who had come to Ritou to show the Inazumans that even if they believed in different gods, they could still come together over a card game and put their differences aside. Near the tournament grounds, the Traveler, Charlotte, and Paimon encountered Kirara again, who was delivering packages. After defeating Miko in the final battle, Kokomi guessed that the Card Snatcher's mystery lay in Kirara's travel route, as the time and place matched perfectly. All of her boxes were very light, so there could only be one thing in them: cards with a chest image. And since she had picked up the package before meeting the Card Snatcher, there could have been multiple criminals at work. After putting the facts together, the nekomata remembered that all of her packages had a common destination in Sumeru: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Approximately 100 paces down the road from Caravan Ribat towards the desert, near the first Flaming Flower,\"</color> so the Traveler, Charlotte, and Paimon asked to go with her to deliver the package."

During the meeting with the clients, the nekomata tried to find out about the contents of the package, but the Treasure Hoarders who received it attacked the courier. After Cyno and the others helped fight off the attack, the Treasure Hoarders admitted that they were tired of stealing and decided to pull off something big and steal prized treasures from different nations all at the same time to increase their authority. To quickly communicate the plan to the others, they suddenly came up with the idea to use cards and printed a chest card back. All Treasure Hoarders knew that if the chest was covered with wet dirt or sand and then rubbed, the message would be revealed: <color=#ffffffd9>\"My fellow hoarders, this is the big job we've all been waiting for. Take up your daggers, put on your masks, and round up your Sumpter Beastsâ€¦ Oh, and for those of you without Sumpter Beasts...\"</color> The message then went on to give details of the plan and the time. Some Treasure Hoarders began playing Genius Invokation TCG, and the cards with the message were put into circulation. Realizing their mistake, the Treasure Hoarders decided to collect all the cards so that no one else could find out about their plan, so they stole, won, or bought the card backs."

They learned from the village chief that a scholar from the Akademiya lived in the village, but no one knew him.

Gulab was sick with Eleazar, a disease that existed only in Sumeru and arose from forbidden knowledge. The disease was characterized by dark scales on the skin, numbness of the limbs, and, in its last stage, death. If it were not for the bandages on his hands, it would have been difficult to guess he was ill, but no one wanted to be friends with him. Despite this, Gulab was calm, kind, and always in a good mood. Garvipidam was the only one who wanted to be friends with the sick boy, and from then on, they became inseparable. They entered the Sumeru Akademiya together, where Gulab achieved the title of Rtawahist Dastur. But soon after, the disease began to worsen, serious complications began, and Gulab became bedridden. He was treated in the hospital, so he had to leave his research. To support his friend, Garvipidam went to the hospital every day, even when his friend said there was no need to go so often. When they had nothing to do in the hospital, the friends began to amuse themselves by coloring cards, and gradually these cards turned into Genius Invokation TCG. Soon, the entire hospital was playing a card game. When creating the game, Garvipidam used theoretical knowledge of the elements, dreaming of continuing the research together when Gulab recovered."

The King Deshret's sages bet on which effect would win out in the end and asked the leader of the priestly class. Hermanubis, to make a conjecture as to the eventual result. <color=#ffffffd9>\"Both forms of power clash directly, as sharp spears striking sturdy shields,\"</color> said Hermanubis, <color=#ffffffd9>\"And they must each yield unto the other, and take a step back. This is the principle of equilibrium.\"</color> In the end, the final result was that the cup became pure silver, while the silted water within became a fine liquor with suspended grains of silver. Yet the Crocodile King and Ibis King did not understand Hermanubis's admonishment, instead continuing their battle. In the end, they invented a strange summoning magic. And now, the two of them have traversed millennia to continue their battle upon the field of Genius Invokation TCG."

Due to its unique specifications, the request to produce a sample was misunderstood as one to craft an actual weapon, which upset the Yae Publishing House. However, Fukumoto, who was present when the bow was delivered, was impressed by this turn of events and wrote a story that was later included in the book as an appendix. According to the story, the bow, decorated with precious stones, was once in the treasury of the Ibis King. The Crocodile King was confident that whoever wielded this bow would become the most skilled archer under King Deshret, so he was determined to obtain the bow at all costs. The prussian green-skinned young man asked if he could obtain the bow if he became the most brilliant archer of all, but was only met with a smirk in response. When King Deshret had long disappeared, the Crocodile King decided to trample the sea of sands in the name of the \"Rite of Duels,\" all to erase the barriers between the multitude of worlds and thus incite a frenzied war. To stop him, a lone\nholding a golden bow climbed the steps leading to the ritual. After this battle, Sobek was sealed by Toth in the \"Room of Duels\" for his thirst for a great war and his attempt to destroy the walls of the worlds. The \"Room of Duels\" was like some kind of sanctuary: it was impossible to escape from it and cheat unnoticed. Even the Crocodile King could not leave this place."

When Sobek entered the sealed \"Room of Duels\" again using the young man, he saw a longbow held by the phantom. It was as if time stood still, so that the remnant of his soul could pass through the shattered doors and scattered corridors, and return to the chamber of treachery and machinations. Grasping the inescapable golden arrow fired off by the Bow of Secret Rites that was zipping towards him, he saved the body from an unfortunate fate of being impaled through the chest. But at this moment, the secret ritual dissipated, the arrow was dispelled, and the silhouette of the bow-wielder vanished in a flash. Sobek grabbed the longbow before it clattered to the ground. His multiple attempts at seizing this gold-forged bow had ended in failure, which contributed to the rift between him and the Ibis King. Alas, when he finally acquired the treasure that he had long coveted, he found that his heart was as cold as a stagnant swamp, with nary a ripple of joy. The Crocodile King pondered and concluded that he no longer had such a great yearning to satisfy those unfulfilled desires as he did in his youth."

Although the prussian green-skinned king was close to victory, the young man was able to prevail.
