Loneliness Syndrome is a type of mental disorder that causes people suffering from it to often feel extremely lonely and lose interest in many mundane activities. It is said that there are many factors surrounding the development of this illness: from heredity factors and one's state of mind to environmental factors and even Ley Line disorder effects. Some even say it could be caused by contamination from god’s remains. Zuria's son developed uncontrollable delusions, and he could no longer distinguish fantasy from reality. The woman asked Freminet to create a clockwork penguin, Thelxie, from her son's dreams so that he could return to reality. Leskot believed that the creature from the legend did not want to kidnap children but sang out of loneliness and longing for communication."

They had once started a book together, but the disorder progressed too quickly, and the boy was unable to draw more than the first page. Zuria wanted to finish the book but change the ending so that the Water Imp prince and his friends could eventually restore their kingdom. She hoped to dispel the loneliness and sadness of her son so that he could see a world full of hope again.\nAlthough Freminet was prepared for Zuria's idea to fail, he really wanted to help her and her son. At the House of the Hearth, where he grew up, under the previous director, he saw many cases of Loneliness Syndrome. There were not many positive outcomes, and in the worst cases, patients would die. He was able to feel the fantasies of his son Zuria since in the past he also had his own imaginary fairy-tale world, from which he drew moral support and inspiration. His world was Penguin Town, a peaceful place with lots of penguin residents, and they were all really good at making clockwork toys. Penguin Pers, created by Freminet, was the hero of these fantasies and became a friend of Freminet who always supported him."

At this time, the little fairy in the group, Paimon, revealed her true Goddess form to her companions. She praised the companions for their purity, and to reward them, she bestowed upon them many blessings, and even prayed that the Prince would be able to fulfill his goal. Bathed under the Goddess's glory, the Prince and his companions charged into the bastion of evil, chased away the monsters and rescued the pretty Water Imps from their imprisonment. The Prince finally managed to reclaim his kingdom, but he couldn’t get the crown. It was within the Prince's reach, but the monsters took it with them as they fled. They haven't given up and are sure to return, but the prince is certain to reclaim the crown the next time they fight. The brilliant rainbow shall descend onto the kingdom once more.\nWhen the crown for the coronation ceremony was ready, Freminet, the Traveler, and Paimon went to the house of Zuria Destree, since they could not find it. Family doctor Jalacan said that Leskot Destree suffered from Loneliness Syndrome once. A month before Freminet met Madame Destree, Lescot went in search of a Water Imp, tied a bunch of heavy seashells onto his body, and walked into this open stretch of water, never coming back. At this time, Zuria was organizing an art exhibition, which she prepared especially for her son, so she was not around. Plunging into regret, Madame Destree fell ill with the same disease and began to believe that her son was alive. Zuria no longer remembered the boy's real name and believed that her son's name was Thelxie and he was the prince of the Water Imp kingdom. When Freminet created Thelxie, Zuria's condition seemed to improve, but all night before the coronation she stared at the seashell her son left behind and the words he wrote on it. Since the last days were beneficial for the woman, the Traveler, Paimon, and Freminet decided to complete the journey and show her that her child had found happiness in the world of her dreams."

All of Erinnyes is the information system of that visitor, through which he can sense changes in the water veins.

There is a cannon on the ship, which can be accessed by the tavern waitress if a few riddles are solved. Shooting the cannon reveals an underground tunnel hidden behind the stones. The tavern's helmsman and boss is Pitot. Mysterious Xenochromatic Crystals, large crystals obtained by defeating the extremely powerful Fontemer Aberrants in Morte Region, can be exchanged with Pitot for Mora. Pitot \"ruled\" many people’s lives once and often changed their course. For those who volunteered to dive into the depths of the ocean, Mr. Pitot was the only helmsman they could rely on. Their helmsman protects everyone who works at The Rusty Rudder. Pitot is also a certified player and, as the boss, he is directly involved in interacting with guests and helping them pick their drinks. He's more than down for playing all sorts of games, including Genius Invokation TCG. He has sharpened his card skills a great deal. A tavern boss who loses to guests might be called upon pour some put on the house, after all. The tavern's regular is a drunkard, Covault. He once worked for the Lumidouce Harbor Watcher, Chaussivert, but betrayed his boss and began collaborating with a gentleman from Snezhnaya and former Fontaine Research Institute researcher, Nacker, who stole the Arkhium Kinetic Core from the institute.\nThere are also two more certified players in the tavern: Lasselin and Choneaux. Lasselin is Chief Mate of The Rusty Rudder. It seems that she has played quite a few games with guests and can execute offensives with absolute calm. That said, card games seem to just be a lead-in, with the conversation eventually being steered towards \"good wine.\" Choneaux is a reporter who is always looking for that exclusive scoop. Such new isn't that easy to come by, so he makes his own — for example, by covering duels between extraordinary card players. Although most readers haven't the slightest inkling about the players he mentions, those pieces earn enough to pay for both his expenditures and alcohol."

When Nacker stole the kinetic core, the Institute hired a special investigator named Fusilier. Her main task was to return the Arkhium Kinetic Core as soon as possible since it was an extremely unstable prototype. During the investigation, Fusilier discovered Eastinghouse's house, as it was emitting clear indicators of residual energy around it. Edwin Eastinghouse deliberately led the investigation to Nacker and urged him to return to the institute and confess to his crimes. Edwin wanted to return to his research and claimed that he was not present when the core exploded. Since Eastinghouse harmed the institute, he was imprisoned in the Fortress of Meropide along with Nacker."

There were notes in the temporary camp about adding a language output module to Thelxie.

The girl got the dog from Autumn when she went to the Fortress of Meropide for the murder of her second husband. Nana once lived in the Court of Fontaine and appeared in a new outfit and accessories before bed, during every meal, at tea parties, dances, walks, and dates. And Don Quijano, according to Penny, was wanted by the Maison of Gardiennage. Several years ago, he, Rouge, and the blind Freeman, who can be found at The Rusty Rudder, went on a journey, but they were followed by mercenaries. When they ran out of supplies, Don Quijano rushed at his pursuers, not sparing himself, and defeated three of them. Penny found herself at a crossroads: she didn't know whether to start growing up or remain a child. She even made a list of the pros and cons of growing up, but she still couldn't decide. Thanks to the help of the Traveler and Paimon, Penny decided to take up the Adventurers' Guild's training as an adventurer to explore the world, and the Traveler wrote her a letter of recommendation to the Guild as a gift for growing up."

The knight with sea-colored eyes confessed her sins and asked to comfort her soul in expulsion and exile. When the knight finished her speech, she drew her shining sword. A beam of watery light shone from it and lit the valley.\nLegend has it that Daeira, a maiden by the lake, gifted the sword to Erinnyes so she could perform countless deeds. Many conflicts settled in peace by its blade, and the ravages of war laid to rest in these lands. It had drunk the crimson blood of the unrighteous, and oathbreakers and the unjust have fallen like flakes of snow to the ground before Hauteclaire's purity. Its golden hilt was inlaid in jewels, and only people with pure souls were worthy of it. Erinnyes believed that one day there would be a noble person, who would lift the sword again, and they would do deeds greater than Erinnyes's."

Egeria gave her a flower as pure as Lakelight to the last Lochknight as a farewell gift. To this day, Fontaine maintains the tradition of picking a Lily and giving it to those on long journeys, wishing one another a road ahead as tranquil as pure water, and that those most precious will be able to follow its cool light, returning to their side.

The intent was not only to increase the harbor's size, but also to construct numerous auxiliary facilities such as hotels, restaurants, and taverns, but for unknown reasons, the project was postponed, and Doutey resigned. Currently, Cassigneul is the administrator of the harbor. Her previous job was related to harbor management-related matters, but this is her first time in an official managerial role, and it is not easy for her due to the huge volume of cargo turnover.

Conditions in the port and the surrounding waters are extremely difficult: shallows alternate with rifts, and sometimes there are even reefs. All merchant ships entering or leaving the sea need a navigator on board to guide them through a fast and safe route. Due to the difficulties that arose in Lumidouce Harbor, many navigators quit, and the remaining ones were exhausted to the limit and made mistakes. The underwater environment can sometimes shift: currents could cause a sunken ship to drift over and end up blocking one route, while the same currents might simultaneously open up another route that was previously impassable. For ease of navigation, the port periodically hired specialists who carried out hydrological surveys. All received data was entered into the map, and then the updated charts were distributed to all the navigators. Hydrological surveys have not been carried out recently, and navigators rely only on their experience and outdated maps. Ms. Cassigneul is planning on conducting another comprehensive hydrological survey, but it will take a long time.\nA researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute, Hautemontagne, once worked in Lumidouce Harbor. She was working on a project to extend the aquabus lines to the port, but the project was suspended, and Cassigneul sent Hautemontagne to Chenyu Vale. The head of Spina di Rosula, Navia, is planning to resume the project and build a fourth aquabus line to the port.\nThe self-proclaimed harbor-watcher is Chaussivert. One day, Concini of Snezhnaya hired several people from the port, including Chaussivert's team, to transport a researcher Nacker, and the kinetic core he had stolen from the Fontaine Research Institute. One of Concini's men wanted to hire Chaussivert, but he refused and was attacked for that. When a special investigator from the institute, Fusilier, arrived at Lumidouce Harbor looking for Nacker, at first she suspected Chaussivert of involvement in the disappearance of the Arkhium Kinetic Core. Since the core was unstable and could explode at any time, Chaussivert agreed to help Fusilier and the Traveler in finding Nacker. When Nacker was captured and sent to the Fortress of Meropide, a note was left at the port stating that all materials and equipment associated with the Arkhium Kinetic Core were to be destroyed."

After a while, he saved Melusine Nadia with amnesia caused by a traumatic brain injury and wanted to cure her. At first, he planned to find the treasures of the Liliacruces Forum and get rich, but his idea turned out to be a failure. Now Urville is training hard to become a sailor and earn money for Nadia's treatment.\nOne day, Lumidouce Harbor was the center of an investigation into the smuggling of Imitation Sinthe, a new drug that had appeared in Fontaine. Criminals transported drugs across the border in the stomachs of cats, which the \"Humane Society\" sent to other countries, so no one could detect them. A Garde Elodie, in charge of port security, directed the investigation to the trail of Pierre from the Research Institute and Bernard from the \"Humane Society.\" In fact, she was the main criminal in this case, and Pierre and Bernard did not even suspect that someone else was involved in the case. Elodie switched shifts at the port to coincide with the activities of the \"Humane Society,\" organized the log entries so that anyone reading would immediately suspect the organization, and did not include records of her activities. Thanks to the help of famous illusionists, Lyney and Lynette, as well as the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse, Elodie was caught.\nTwo certified players can be found in this subarea, Mermet and Chourei. Mermet is a Navigator at Lumidouce Harbor. Because her job is inextricably linked to the rate at which vessels come and go from the harbor, she often has a smattering of half-hour leisure slots scattered throughout the day, which she has used to learn Genius Invokation TCG. She often tests herself against inbound sailors. Chourei is a Melusine and a member of the Maison Gardiennage stationed at Lumidouce Harbor. She is in charge of keeping order there — a task that her gentler personality sometimes makes tricky. Fortunately, after being told as much by the port master, she found that Genius Invokation TCG was a good way to get two parties to sit down at a table to talk. Watching all these matches has also helped make her a qualified player herself.\nIn this subarea, the World Quest"
