There is a cannon on the ship, which can be accessed by the tavern waitress if a few riddles are solved. Shooting the cannon reveals an underground tunnel hidden behind the stones. The tavern's helmsman and boss is Pitot. Mysterious Xenochromatic Crystals, large crystals obtained by defeating the extremely powerful Fontemer Aberrants in Morte Region, can be exchanged with Pitot for Mora. Pitot \"ruled\" many people’s lives once and often changed their course. For those who volunteered to dive into the depths of the ocean, Mr. Pitot was the only helmsman they could rely on. Their helmsman protects everyone who works at The Rusty Rudder. Pitot is also a certified player and, as the boss, he is directly involved in interacting with guests and helping them pick their drinks. He's more than down for playing all sorts of games, including Genius Invokation TCG. He has sharpened his card skills a great deal. A tavern boss who loses to guests might be called upon pour some put on the house, after all. The tavern's regular is a drunkard, Covault. He once worked for the Lumidouce Harbor Watcher, Chaussivert, but betrayed his boss and began collaborating with a gentleman from Snezhnaya and former Fontaine Research Institute researcher, Nacker, who stole the Arkhium Kinetic Core from the institute.\nThere are also two more certified players in the tavern: Lasselin and Choneaux. Lasselin is Chief Mate of The Rusty Rudder. It seems that she has played quite a few games with guests and can execute offensives with absolute calm. That said, card games seem to just be a lead-in, with the conversation eventually being steered towards \"good wine.\" Choneaux is a reporter who is always looking for that exclusive scoop. Such new isn't that easy to come by, so he makes his own — for example, by covering duels between extraordinary card players. Although most readers haven't the slightest inkling about the players he mentions, those pieces earn enough to pay for both his expenditures and alcohol."

When Nacker stole the kinetic core, the Institute hired a special investigator named Fusilier. Her main task was to return the Arkhium Kinetic Core as soon as possible since it was an extremely unstable prototype. During the investigation, Fusilier discovered Eastinghouse's house, as it was emitting clear indicators of residual energy around it. Edwin Eastinghouse deliberately led the investigation to Nacker and urged him to return to the institute and confess to his crimes. Edwin wanted to return to his research and claimed that he was not present when the core exploded. Since Eastinghouse harmed the institute, he was imprisoned in the Fortress of Meropide along with Nacker."

There were notes in the temporary camp about adding a language output module to Thelxie. Freminet chose the encrypted code from the House of the Hearth since there were several unused main boards in the shelter warehouse and this language was well suited for the translation module of Freminet's own diving suit.

The girl got the dog from Autumn when she went to the Fortress of Meropide for the murder of her second husband. Nana once lived in the Court of Fontaine and appeared in a new outfit and accessories before bed, during every meal, at tea parties, dances, walks, and dates. And Don Quijano, according to Penny, was wanted by the Maison of Gardiennage. Several years ago, he, Rouge, and the blind Freeman, who can be found at The Rusty Rudder, went on a journey, but they were followed by mercenaries. When they ran out of supplies, Don Quijano rushed at his pursuers, not sparing himself, and defeated three of them. Penny found herself at a crossroads: she didn't know whether to start growing up or remain a child. She even made a list of the pros and cons of growing up, but she still couldn't decide. Thanks to the help of the Traveler and Paimon, Penny decided to take up the Adventurers' Guild's training as an adventurer to explore the world, and the Traveler wrote her a letter of recommendation to the Guild as a gift for growing up."

Erinnyes thanked the Mistress of Many Waters for showing her the Pure Grail and for allowing her to complete this journey. She promised that the survived Lochknights would continue to loyally serve Egeria and her future kingdom, following that noble musician, and that they would pursue the lingering shadows, restoring justice. The knight with sea-colored eyes confessed her sins and asked to comfort her soul in expulsion and exile. When the knight finished her speech, she drew her shining sword. A beam of watery light shone from it and lit the valley.\nLegend has it that Daeira, a maiden by the lake, gifted the sword to Erinnyes so she could perform countless deeds. Many conflicts settled in peace by its blade, and the ravages of war laid to rest in these lands. It had drunk the crimson blood of the unrighteous, and oathbreakers and the unjust have fallen like flakes of snow to the ground before Hauteclaire's purity. Its golden hilt was inlaid in jewels, and only people with pure souls were worthy of it. Erinnyes believed that one day there would be a noble person, who would lift the sword again, and they would do deeds greater than Erinnyes's."

One of the main destinations from Lumidouce Harbor is Yilong Wharf in Liyue. The former port manager, Doutey, planned to expand the harbor to better cope with the enormous volume of trade. The intent was not only to increase the harbor's size, but also to construct numerous auxiliary facilities such as hotels, restaurants, and taverns, but for unknown reasons, the project was postponed, and Doutey resigned. Currently, Cassigneul is the administrator of the harbor. Her previous job was related to harbor management-related matters, but this is her first time in an official managerial role, and it is not easy for her due to the huge volume of cargo turnover. Since the port expansion project has never been implemented, some workers are considering finding work in the city or going to work at Romaritime Harbor on the border with Sumeru."

Conditions in the port and the surrounding waters are extremely difficult: shallows alternate with rifts, and sometimes there are even reefs. All merchant ships entering or leaving the sea need a navigator on board to guide them through a fast and safe route. Due to the difficulties that arose in Lumidouce Harbor, many navigators quit, and the remaining ones were exhausted to the limit and made mistakes. The underwater environment can sometimes shift: currents could cause a sunken ship to drift over and end up blocking one route, while the same currents might simultaneously open up another route that was previously impassable. For ease of navigation, the port periodically hired specialists who carried out hydrological surveys. All received data was entered into the map, and then the updated charts were distributed to all the navigators. Hydrological surveys have not been carried out recently, and navigators rely only on their experience and outdated maps. Ms. Cassigneul is planning on conducting another comprehensive hydrological survey, but it will take a long time.\nA researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute, Hautemontagne, once worked in Lumidouce Harbor. She was working on a project to extend the aquabus lines to the port, but the project was suspended, and Cassigneul sent Hautemontagne to Chenyu Vale. The head of Spina di Rosula, Navia, is planning to resume the project and build a fourth aquabus line to the port.\nThe self-proclaimed harbor-watcher is Chaussivert. One day, Concini of Snezhnaya hired several people from the port, including Chaussivert's team, to transport a researcher Nacker, and the kinetic core he had stolen from the Fontaine Research Institute. One of Concini's men wanted to hire Chaussivert, but he refused and was attacked for that. When a special investigator from the institute, Fusilier, arrived at Lumidouce Harbor looking for Nacker, at first she suspected Chaussivert of involvement in the disappearance of the Arkhium Kinetic Core. Since the core was unstable and could explode at any time, Chaussivert agreed to help Fusilier and the Traveler in finding Nacker. When Nacker was captured and sent to the Fortress of Meropide, a note was left at the port stating that all materials and equipment associated with the Arkhium Kinetic Core were to be destroyed."

        "text": "An unlucky treasure hunter, Urville, works at the port. Many years ago, a Melusine (possibly Nadia) saved him from ball octopuses, and he wanted to grow up and help people. After a while, he saved Melusine Nadia with amnesia caused by a traumatic brain injury and wanted to cure her. At first, he planned to find the treasures of the Liliacruces Forum and get rich, but his idea turned out to be a failure. Now Urville is training hard to become a sailor and earn money for Nadia's treatment.\nOne day, Lumidouce Harbor was the center of an investigation into the smuggling of Imitation Sinthe, a new drug that had appeared in Fontaine. Criminals transported drugs across the border in the stomachs of cats, which the \"Humane Society\" sent to other countries, so no one could detect them. A Garde Elodie, in charge of port security, directed the investigation to the trail of Pierre from the Research Institute and Bernard from the \"Humane Society.\" In fact, she was the main criminal in this case, and Pierre and Bernard did not even suspect that someone else was involved in the case. Elodie switched shifts at the port to coincide with the activities of the \"Humane Society,\" organized the log entries so that anyone reading would immediately suspect the organization, and did not include records of her activities. Thanks to the help of famous illusionists, Lyney and Lynette, as well as the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse, Elodie was caught.\nTwo certified players can be found in this subarea, Mermet and Chourei. Mermet is a Navigator at Lumidouce Harbor. Because her job is inextricably linked to the rate at which vessels come and go from the harbor, she often has a smattering of half-hour leisure slots scattered throughout the day, which she has used to learn Genius Invokation TCG. She often tests herself against inbound sailors. Chourei is a Melusine and a member of the Maison Gardiennage stationed at Lumidouce Harbor. She is in charge of keeping order there — a task that her gentler personality sometimes makes tricky. Fortunately, after being told as much by the port master, she found that Genius Invokation TCG was a good way to get two parties to sit down at a table to talk. Watching all these matches has also helped make her a qualified player herself.\nIn this subarea, the World Quest"

Some even say it could be caused by contamination from god’s remains. Zuria's son developed uncontrollable delusions, and he could no longer distinguish fantasy from reality. The woman asked Freminet to create a clockwork penguin, Thelxie, from her son's dreams so that he could return to reality.

She praised the companions for their purity, and to reward them, she bestowed upon them many blessings, and even prayed that the Prince would be able to fulfill his goal. Bathed under the Goddess's glory, the Prince and his companions charged into the bastion of evil, chased away the monsters and rescued the pretty Water Imps from their imprisonment. The Prince finally managed to reclaim his kingdom, but he couldn’t get the crown. It was within the Prince's reach, but the monsters took it with them as they fled. They haven't given up and are sure to return, but the prince is certain to reclaim the crown the next time they fight. The brilliant rainbow shall descend onto the kingdom once more.\nWhen the crown for the coronation ceremony was ready, Freminet, the Traveler, and Paimon went to the house of Zuria Destree, since they could not find it. Family doctor Jalacan said that Leskot Destree suffered from Loneliness Syndrome once. A month before Freminet met Madame Destree, Lescot went in search of a Water Imp, tied a bunch of heavy seashells onto his body, and walked into this open stretch of water, never coming back. At this time, Zuria was organizing an art exhibition, which she prepared especially for her son, so she was not around. Plunging into regret, Madame Destree fell ill with the same disease and began to believe that her son was alive. Zuria no longer remembered the boy's real name and believed that her son's name was Thelxie and he was the prince of the Water Imp kingdom. When Freminet created Thelxie, Zuria's condition seemed to improve, but all night before the coronation she stared at the seashell her son left behind and the words he wrote on it. Since the last days were beneficial for the woman, the Traveler, Paimon, and Freminet decided to complete the journey and show her that her child had found happiness in the world of her dreams."

The woman said that at the moment when she placed the crown on Thelxie's head, she felt like she really saw something beautiful. Her child had returned, and he told her that he loved her. According to her, that was when she was finally able to bid farewell to her son. She felt like at that moment, she was healed by some mystical power, and she was filled with courage from head to toe.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

One day she met a \"visitor\" (presumably, Neuvillette), and he taught her the language and asked her to defend the island. All of Erinnyes is the information system of that visitor, through which he can sense changes in the water veins. The weeping willow near the lake collected information, the fog processed it, and the Loch Urania spring sent it. When the filth began to destroy the roots of the weeping willow connecting the water veins, Pahsiv turned for help to the Traveler and Paimon, who were passing by. If the willow roots were destroyed by the Root-Consuming Tumor, the information system would fail to function, and the visitor's senses would be affected."

They took it for danger and warned Pahsiv, but she only petted the Vishap, and he immediately calmed down.
