        "text": "About 500 years ago, Mary-Ann was a pupil of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, an orphanage in Fontaine. The gentle Oceanid Lyris was the Director of the Institute, and the former Admiral of the White Armada Basil Elton was the Vice Director.\nWhen 500 years ago, Fontaine encountered Cataclysm and Elynas, a being from the Abyss, Basil led the Fontainians to protect the nation and left Mary-Ann and Alain to be raised by her old friend Emanuel Guillotin, a former member of the Marechaussee Hunters. Guillotin did not like children, but for the sake of his old friend, he accepted them, even though he never became their real father.\nAt the Institute, Mary-Ann met other children: Jakob Baker (later Ingold) and Rene de Petrichor, with whom they became friends for many years. Alain later became a researcher at the Institute of Natural Philosophy and made a breakthrough in studying the powers of Pneuma and Ousia, and together with Mary-Ann, they became Marechaussee Hunters. To protect his sister in the service, Alain created the first prototype of a thinking machine — Seymour.\nRene and Jakob founded a secret organization later declared radical, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, while Rene attempted to create Neohumans and avoid the Apocalypse predicted by his world-formula. In their research, they experimented with Scarlet Quartz from the Dragonspine, Dark Mud from the Chasm, Khvarena and Amrita from Sumeru, and the flesh and blood of Elynas. Jakob Ingold gained powers sustained by absorbing Elynas's flesh and became the first Neohuman. The Institute of Natural Philosophy assistant, Carter, changed his form when Rene tried to save him from an incurable disease through experimentation.\nWhen the Marechaussee Hunters learned how far the Narzissenkreuz Ordo research to revive Elynas had gone, they, along with Mary-Ann and Seymour, were sent to stop and arrest the members of the order. A battle occurred between Marechaussee Phantom's agents and the Narzissenkreuz Ordo's members (Jakob, Lyris, and Caterpillar). During the battle, Mary-Ann Guillotin was seriously injured, and Lyris absorbed her consciousness by hugging her. A new Oceanid, Mary-Ann, was born from this merge. Mary-Ann was no longer either Lyris or Mary-Ann Guillotin but embodied their shared consciousness and desires and was something beyond human or Oceanid capable of creating other Oceanids.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
