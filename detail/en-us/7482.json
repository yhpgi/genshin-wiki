There are many stories about him: he sailed on a ship into the belly of a great whale, fought with a dragon upon the frozen plains for seven days, and lost his beloved Snegurochka due to the wicked tricks of the changelings. One day, he fell into a hitherto undiscovered kingdom, the capital of which sank underground due to some ancient disaster. The solemn and silent king still sat upon his massive, chiseled white throne, the scepter in his hands not yet eaten away by insects, and the silver-white trees in the courtyard were like the arms of a mother or a lover, holding the virtuous and wise priest in their embrace. Violent monsters began to awaken from their slumber, and one of these monsters was a dragon whose treasure was an infinite hoard of gold. But the boy was kind and brave and knew that gold was the true cause of calamity and chaos, so he only took a small amount, enough for his own needs and to cure his sick friends."

There he saw the endless world of the Abyss, and a swordswoman named Skirk, disciple of one of the Khaenri'ahn Sinners, Surtalogi, noticed the boy. During his three months in the Abyss, Ajax learned to move freely through the dark realm and to incite conflicts using his predisposition to chaos. Immediately after the fall, the boy had a dream: he was deep underwater, and around him was the endless seabed. And then a whale appeared before him, so huge that it took his breath away. In the Abyss, the boy met the All-Devouring Narwhal — Surtalogi's pet, who several years later became the reason for the fulfillment of Fontaine's prophecy. When Ajax asked his master why she took him on, she answered that he had awakened \"something,\" that it had left its marks on him, and that combat training would be useful to him in the future. In addition, in the Abyss, Ajax received the Foul Legacy — a special, extremely dangerous power that put his body under tremendous strain."

Pulcinella accepted Ajax into the Fatui and, under the pretext of punishment, forced him to start from the very bottom and dedicate himself to serving the Tsaritsa. Ajax's uncontrollable thirst for battle was fully satisfied by his service to the Fatui, and his growing ego was sated by victories over powerful opponents.

It was his reward for defeating terrible monsters and a memento of countless battles. The Delusion was only a sign of honor for Childe, and all his attention was focused on the Tsaritsa, who on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him. Her gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp. She was not only the sacrosanct Cryo Archon but also a true warrior. Thus did Childe, having received his Delusion, swear an oath of fealty to the one and only Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya. Despite his young age, Childe is one of the most dangerous Fatui Harbingers, whose easy-going appearance hides a deadly slaughterer who is a master of all types of weapons and martial arts. The only thing that can be stronger than his skills is his love of battle and conflict. Childe enjoys using risky tactics and craves meeting strong opponents. His arrogance is backed by his rich combat experience and perfect skills. However, Tartaglia is not on friendly terms with the other Harbingers and does not agree with the deceitful and treacherous methods of Fatui's work. The Harbingers themselves believe that Childe's quarrelsome personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, and they constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from Snezhnaya as possible so that they can avoid the fallout, where Tartaglia always finds himself in the center of chaos and conflict. Despite his character and unceremonious manner, Childe is considered a responsible and trustworthy person who always keeps his promises."

To avoid conflict between the Liyue resident and the Harbinger, who had endangered the country, Paimon presented Childe as an Adventurer from Mondstadt. After Tartaglia and the others dealt with the monsters that appeared, Shiki Taishou touched the mechanism that was supposed to open the door, but instead, it rearranged the rooms of the Mystic Chamber. The Harbinger was locked inside the domain and was forced to fight for several days. Despite this, Childe enjoyed fighting and wanted to participate in battles in all the rooms."

After Xinyan, Tartaglia, Traveler, and Paimon helped Shiki Taishou regain all of his memories and gain full control of the Mystic Onmyou Chamber, the Harbinger revealed his purpose for coming to Inazuma. When the sixth of the Fatui Harbingers, Scaramouche, took possession of the Electro Gnosis, the Fatui lost contact with him. Believing that the sudden appearance of a domain filled with monsters might be related to the missing Harbinger, Childe went to investigate but was unable to find Scaramoiche.

The Harbinger saved the boy and got rid of the monsters, and on the way back, he met the fireworks master, Nagonahara Yoimiya. The girl helped the children track down a powerful demon, Great Mujina Youkai, and the boy Childe saved, was one of those children. According to legend, the demon scared and bullied children who went out at night. Although Yoimiya and Tartaglia knew that the Great Mujina Yokai was an invention of adults to prevent children from running away alone, Tartaglia agreed to cover for the children and protect them from danger. Yoimiya guessed Childe's position because she heard about what happened in Liyue, but she saw how much the Harbinger cared about the children and sincerely wanted to help them, so she allowed him to stay. When Tartaglia was about to leave Inazuma, the girl helped him choose souvenirs for his siblings and also offered to take the fireworks she had recently designed.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

In order to help their friend and solve the case, the Traveler and Paimon collected evidence pointing to a native of Snezhnaya and an Adventurer, Vacher. Over twenty years ago, he came to Fontaine, where he met another adventurer, Vigneire, and fell in love with her. During one of her underwater expeditions, Vigneire came into contact with the waters of the Primordial Sea, which dissolved her in front of Vacher, since all Fontainians were once Oceanids, and the waters of the Primordial Sea returned them to their original form. Vacher was so distraught by her death that he began kidnapping Fontainian girls of Vigneire's age in an attempt to resurrect her. The Traveler and Paimon discovered Vacher's secret laboratory and the missing girls' belongings, and it seemed that the case of the serial disappearances of girls was solved, but the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, a special device created by the Hydro Archon Focalors, found not only Vacher guilty but Childe as well. Since the Oratrice's verdicts were decisive, the Gardes were to escort him to the Fortress of Meropide. Using the Delusion, Tartaglia attacked the Gardes, but the Chief Justice, Neuvillette, defeated him, promising to find out the whole truth."

Although the Traveler and Paimon found out the circumstances of their friend's disappearance, they were never able to find him. It turned out that Childe had worked hard in the Fortress, which earned him the respect of the other prisoners, and they helped him escape into a drainpipe, from which he ended up in the Primordial Sea.

Although all Fontainians saw the main threat in the flood of the Primordial Sea, it turned out to be the All-Devouring Narwhal, which the Traveler saw through Childe's Vision. The monster did not belong to Teyvat and had traversed the stars, weeping all the while. It had been greedily consuming the energy from the planet's Primordial Sea, using it to grow. It was its actions that led to the rise of the sea level. Since the Fontainians had the Primordial Sea in their blood, they attracted the narwhal to themselves, and, leaving the waters of the Primordial Sea, it decided to head straight to the opera house, where so many Fontainians had gathered."

Thanks to the intervention of Neuvillette and Tartaglia, the Harbinger and the narwhal disappeared back into the rift, and those gathered in court began to come up with a new plan to fight the prophecy. When the Chief Justice got the authority to defeat the All-Devouring Narwhal and separate it from the power of the Primordial Sea, he and the Traveler entered the Primordial Sea, where they met Tartaglia's mentor, Skirk, the narwhal, and the Harbinger himself. Due to the prolonged battle with the All-Devouring Narwhal, Childe was left powerless and was later sent to Snezhnaya for treatment. Although the Harbinger was not guilty of the serial disappearances, the Oratrice's verdict was not accidental, and it was this that allowed them to buy time and defeat the All-Devouring Narwhal, saving the Fontainians from dissolution.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Even after buying him a Mr. Cyclops kite, a special meal, and a tour of Liyue Harbor, Teucer missed his brother and wanted to spend time with him. When the Traveler and Paimon took the child to Childe, who was collecting debts from the Treasure Hoarders, the Harbinger had to pretend to sell toys. And when Tartaglia had to give a welcoming speech to the Fatui recruits, he told his brother that they were new toy salesmen. When Teucer saw his brother fighting the recruits, he wanted to learn how to fight as well, so he could protect his sister Tonia, and Childe promised to teach him when he returned to Snezhnaya. Before sending Teucer home, Childe decided to fulfill his dream and take him to the Liyue Institute for Toy Research, which was actually a research center for another Harbinger, Il Dottore. A few days before the boy arrived from Snezhnaya, the Ruin Guards in the center went out of control and began attacking people nearby, but Tartaglia was ready to protect his brother from any danger. When they reached the end of the research center, the Harbinger saw many Ruin Guards that had received energy. To prevent Teucer from seeing his brother's battle with Mr. Cyclops, Childe suggested playing hide-and-seek and counting to 60. As time was running out, Tartaglia used the Foul Legacy form to defeat all the Guards. Although he had used an extremely dangerous Foul Legacy transformation during his last encounter with the Traveler in the Golden House and was still recovering from his injuries, he could not allow his brother's dream to be destroyed."

Haha, she's the type to keep to herself.\"\n\"And, let's see... She's an alright cook. Could've been the creatures in that space tasting a little off in general, of course.\"\n\"We initially agreed to swing by my place after leaving. I wanted to let her try my family's homemade sausages this year. It's a real shame she couldn't make it...\"\n\"But enough of that. After all, what matters most about my master is her strength... and the sheer arrogance she has to go with it!\"\n\"Hmm? Oh, no, I know what I said. I'm not being ironic, and I mean no insult.\"\n\"As I, Tartaglia, grow stronger every day, I get the chance to know my master's strength anew with each and every sunrise.\"\n\"When we first started my training, she only needed one hand to beat me. That was undoubtedly her arrogance shining through. But when facing a weak opponent, I believe that arrogance is an aesthetic unto itself.\"\n\"To crush them outright would be unbecoming, yet to feign humility, only to turn the tables later on? That, dear comrade, would be far too deliberate.\"\nIn the present day, this \"review\" of Skirk reached her ears while she was drinking in a tavern. She furrowed her brow.\n\"As I've said before, I still communicate normally with those who possess some measure of skill. And the food in the Abyssal rift only tasted off to him because he's an ordinary human.\"\n\"And about training — I don't really care how many hands I use, but I do care how many he'll have left when I'm done teaching.\"\n\"He still needs to live in Teyvat, so he can't just make new limbs for himself with Abyssal energy like I can.\"\n\"Arrogance and carelessness are both dangerous things. It's good that he wants to improve, rather than to show off.\"\n\"Otherwise, I'd start worrying about finding his corpse in some strange nook or cranny.\""

My investigation has still not reached its conclusion.\nHowever, I still believe the judgment of the Oratrice was not rendered arbitrarily.\nFor many years, I have been quite aware that the Oratrice does not simply mechanically repeat the verdict that I give on each case.\nAs a divinely created mechanism, the people's unified faith in the concept of justice is integrated into it.\nNot only can it produce the incredible power of Indemnitium, but it likely also possesses other traits... such as self-awareness.\nWhich is all to say I've been prepared for a situation like this for a long time.\nIn any case, I am inclined to believe that the Oratrice does have a methodology all its own... We just do not have enough information.\nBased on Furina's reaction, I doubt even she had any idea what was going on. She managed to bluff her way through it, though, with time-tested twin tricks of bravado and drama.\nWhile we do intend to get to the bottom of this, for now, we regret to say that the Fatui Harbinger will just have to bide his time in the Fortress of Meropide.\nIf we did incorrectly convict him of crimes he did not commit, we will most certainly compensate him to the fullest extent allowed by the law.\n<color=#ffd780>About Childe's disappearance</color>\nIn reality, this problem is even more thorny than it appears. According to reports from the Fortress of Meropide, Childe recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\nThe details are still unclear. We cannot rule out an escape, but there have also been no reports of him outside of the Fortress of Meropide.\nSpecial guards oversee the Fortress, and its internal systems are extensive. Combined with the special characteristics of the surrounding terrain, an escape should not be possible. I suspect that there's something else behind Childe's disappearance.\nI was only willing to share this information with you because you are friends of Childe, and it is my duty to see justice done.\nI would like you to go to the Fortress of Meropide and investigate Childe's disappearance.\nThis was my proposal during our meeting with The Knave. Rather than allowing her to intervene, I offered to send someone to find out about Childe's situation and report back to her in detail.\nThe Knave did not seem satisfied by my proposal, but she still agreed to go along with it for the time being. Her words were, \"We will talk more once we have that report.\"\n<color=#ffd780>About Childe's innocence</color>\nAbout the initial verdict that was passed on Childe...\nI have investigated his case along many avenues, and I have learned that he once fell into an unknown chasm when he was young. There, by chance, he awakened the All-Devouring Narwhal.\nBut, whether it be by sentiment or reason, that should not have been enough to consider him the root cause of the disaster. At most, he would have had tangential liability.\nAs for the judgment passed by the Oratrice during the trial...\nWhether it was due to that liability by association, or Focalors deliberately using him to buy time for us on the assumption that he would be able to hold the creature off... I cannot say.\nGuess Focalors had Fontainians in mind the whole time. In the end, it was thanks to her that they finally became real humans..."

The bad news is that there was still a huge flood.\n<color=#37ffff>Lyudmila</color> : I see... So, did Lady Arlecchino...\n<color=#37ffff>Mikhail</color> : Nothing to worry about!

I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base."

Knowing his type, he will be sure to swiftly depose anyone who dares to challenge his actions. Hmm... Come to think of it, there will be a lot of interesting news to be heard the next time we gather for drinks. Care to join me when the time comes, Traveler?"
