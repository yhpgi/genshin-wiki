They're all \"Dodocos,\" and they all look the same, after all! So there's no \"you\" or \"me\" for them at all!\nBut only the red, blazing four-leaf clover can let them know the true meaning of \"Dodoco\" and tell each other apart, thus allowing them to play freely with all their friends!\n...At least, that's what my mom says, and she can do just about aaaanything!\nSo, in order to understand what makes a true \"Dodoco,\" they leave their good friends and go to faraway places to make new good friends and become their \"Dodoco,\" too!\nThey'll see all kinds of nice things, hear all kinds of interesting stuff, meet lots of friends... and one day, when their friends are looking at them, at a time when no one expects it — that's when the blazing, sparkling four-leaf clover will appear!\nAnd that's why when a furry Dodoco from the Golden Apple Archipelago tumbles into the sea or leaps into the wind before drifting far, far away, that means that a lucky child is about to meet their bestest friend ever!\nThis small, precious book was given by the freest mother in the world to the luckiest daughter in the world. It chronicles the countless adventures that Dodoco had before meeting her, and the adventures that she and Dodoco have had since — bigger and better adventures filled with sparks, splashes, treasures, and lots of friends!"
