To achieve this goal, they conducted experiments to create Neohumans. The Ordo’s philosophy is based on the records of ancient Remuria, a golden empire that fell thousands of years ago. The Narzissenkreuz Ordo used the \"Seal of Chymical Marriage,\" a magical technique left behind by the Golden Troupe, to identify four essential points in Fontaine. They built the Tower of\nat the intersection of these points to perform a ritual of liberation.\nBecause of their experiments, the organization was declared illegal by the decree of Iudex of Fontaine, Neuvillette, and Alain Guillotin, a former friend of Rene and Jakob. The Marechaussee Phantom was ordered to arrest all members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and seal the Tower of Gestalt.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

A journalist Karl Ingold, who was present during the siege of Poisson, took Rene and Jakob in the family, and, eventually, Jakob took his last name, becoming Jakob Ingold. After the Cataclysm, Rene, Jakob, and Karl left for an expedition to Vourukasha Oasis in Sumeru. Rene became fascinated by Khvarena and the Sacred Lotus, Gaokerena, created by The Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the consciousness of the former Hydro Archon Egeria. He observed that it shared a similar composition to the tissues in the organisms of Jakob and Rene himself but different from the tissues of Karl. Despite Rene's attempts to obtain more data samples to verify this finding, Shamaniyya refused his requests. In addition, he discovered some Khaenri'ahn records, with the help of which he later created the world-formula.\nDuring the expedition, Jakob, a child at the time, fell seriously ill and lapsed into a coma. Desperate to save him, Rene resorted to using powers akin to those of the Abyss. Jakob's body responded favorably to these powers, facilitating his recovery. Emboldened by this success, Rene incorporated the results into his ongoing research. Karl Ingold, however, harbored suspicions regarding Jakob's sudden recovery. To dispel these suspicions, Rene fabricated and altered diaries.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Gradually, the influence and popularity of the organization grew, and some famous researchers, historians, and people from high society joined it.\nYears later, Oceanid Lyris, the former Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, the orphanage where Rene and Jakob grew up, joined the organization.

Among them, he found the term \"Fortuna\" which said that kingdoms rise and fall, and when a civilization is annihilated, a new one will be born from the ashes. This phenomenon turned out to be similar to Rene's computational scheme, called the \"world-formula.\" After countless calculations, he found a discrepancy with Fortuna: unlike the world depicted in these ancient texts, there will be no more new civilizations born. This apocalypse was associated with the ancient prophecy of Fontaine: <color=#ffffffd9>\"In the end, the people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne...\"</color> Like the ancient Remurians, Rene wanted to escape fate and avoid the promised Apocalypse, so he founded the Narzissenkreuz Ordo."

Following moral decay, the will became shackled to bodily form, willpower withered, and humanity became entirely enslaved to their flesh. The Remurians reached heights that were challenging to attain in study and differentiation of the spirit. According to the Harmost Aurelius, all phenomena were divided into four categories: Substance, Property, Quality, and Relation. Quality was the keystone, which is what is often called the \"Quadrant of Qualities\": memories, wishes, soul, and persona. Spirit was also divided into these four components. Among these, the state that came closest to the perfect freedom that divinities possessed was named \"True Will.\" Ancient Remurians saw it as the detachment of human will with such meticulous research. Upon learning of this, Rene decided that separating a person's will could be the key to salvation from the prophecy. The God King Remus created imperishable bodies of stone and bronze for the Remurians. The Remurians wanted to create an object endowed with meaning, the essence of which would be determined only by Quality. One of these items was a sword forged in memory of the Harmost Euergetia. Rene wanted to create Neohumans and separate the will of the Fontainians to wait out the apocalypse and escape fate. At the Narzissenkreuz Institute, Rene discovered the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz, capable of uniting and concentrating the will of many people. In the Narzissenkreuz Ordo's brand of mystical philosophy, the Holy Blade was \"reason,\" that which cuts everything open. It could only be born out of consummate human will. The Ordo used this sword to sever the people's will. Just like the Remurians separated their melody in order to escape the prisons of rotting flesh and gain eternal and independent life, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo wanted to get rid of the shackles of the physical body through the separation of the will."

It turned out that the composition of all of them was similar to the flesh of Elynas, and they had a negative effect on ordinary people. Only Jakob, who was called a \"Neohuman\" by Rene, was able to resist this destructive influence.\nTo counter the prophecy,\nused Lyris's power to absorb people's wills and create a Hydrotulpa. So, he dissolved several agents of the Marechaussee Phantom, probably including Emanuel Guillotin, finding out from his memories that the officials of the Court of Fontaine knew about the existence of the Ordo. He also dissolved the Duelist Champion, Marfisa, to acquire her spear mastery. In addition, some members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo who lost their loyalty disappeared without a trace, without leaving the Tower of Ipsissimus, the Ordo's headquarters.\nIn addition to experiments on Jakob and other people, Rene conducted experiments on Alain Guillotin's assistant, Carter Scherbius, from the Institute of Natural Philosophy, who suffered from an incurable disease. Rene sent his tissue samples to Sumeru, where medicine was advanced, in hopes of getting answers, but no one could offer a solution. Then Jakob put forward the idea of treating Carter with the help of the Abyssal powers, which was used to save Jakob during the desert expedition. After considering Jakob's proposal and discussing all possible risks with Carter, Rene began treatment. Due to experiments on Carter using Abyssal powers, Guillotin broke off all relations with Rene and later, together with Fontaine's Iudex, Neuvillette, signed a decree on the illegality of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and an order for their destruction. An attempt to cure Carter Scherbius led to the destruction of the tissues and death of his body, but the order later managed to transfer part of his memories into the body of a Hilichurl, and thus, Caterpillar was born. He remembered nothing about his previous life but was devoted and grateful to his Master.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Mary-Ann Guillotin was on the verge of death, but she was saved by Lyris, who united their bodies and minds by hugging her, creating a new Oceanid, Mary-Ann.\nAfter the battle between the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and the Marechaussee Phantom, Jakob fled, Caterpillar was arrested and imprisoned in the Fortress of Meropide, and the Narzissenkreuz Ordo building was sealed. This event can be considered the end of the Ordo.\nMany years later, Caterpillar realized that Narzissenkreuz used Jakob, Lyris, and him as a distraction:"

They began to resolve disputes between Fleuve Cendre's \"compatriots,\" bless the newly wedded, and protect the merchants from being extorted, harassed, and blackmailed by the gangs. When the authorities of the Court of Fontaine decided to purge Fleuve Cendre, Baker was arrested and exiled to the Sumeru desert. On the way to exile, he, with the help of his henchmen, fled to Poisson, taking hostage both the city itself and the members of the Maison Gardiennage who were transporting Baker. He made a number of unreasonable demands, so the Marechaussee Hunters intervened. Journalist Karl Ingold arrived in Poisson as a negotiator along with Eduardo's son, Jakob. Back then, the mayor of Poisson was Renaud de Petrichor, whose son was Rene."

As a result, Jakob, and Rene, the Poisson Mayor's son, were left orphans. They were both sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute, an orphanage that often housed the children of criminals. The Director of the Institute was the gentle Oceanid Lyris, who was placed in charge of the Institute as a sign of gratitude to the Hydro Archon Egeria. The Institute's Vice Director was Basil Elton, formerly the head of Fontaine's fleet. At the Institute, Basil Elton told the children a fairytale about the evil dragon Narcissus, and they played Narzissen champions, mages, and princesses. At the orphanage, Jakob met Mary-Ann and Alain, with whom he and Rene became friends. Alain gave Rene and Jakob a pocket watch, and later this pocket watch was instrumental in the resurrection of Narzissenkreuz.\nDuring the Cataclysm 500 years ago, the Institute was disbanded. Basil Elton again led the White Armada and, together with some of the Institute's students, entered into battle with the Abyss creature that appeared in Fontaine. As a farewell, she left Jakob a feather from an unknown bird, which she wore on her hat. She told him to take care of it so that she could take it back when she returned, but she never did. Director Lyris disappeared and was later seen by the Marechaussee Phantom agents wandering around the Institute. She joined the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, a secret society founded by Rene and Jakob, a few years later. Jakob was adopted by Karl Ingold, who was present at the siege of Poisson, and Rene also became part of their family.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

He called himself Narzissenkreuz and decided to be the first on the path to this goal and dissolved his body, hoping to be reborn in a new form.\nThe dissolution of the body did not help Narzissenkreuz to be reborn, so Jakob spent all his efforts to preserve Narzissenkreuz. For many months, Jakob experimented to revive Rene. He extracted part of his personality and sealed it under one of the Orthants in the Primordial Sea. He used Lyris's abilities to dissolve and extract people's wills, the records of the Remurians on the creation of golems, knowledge from Khaenri'ah, and the Holy Blade of\nwhich was the key to concentrating the wills of people. (More than 400 years later, the results of Jakob's research were used by the serial killer Vacher, who tried to revive his beloved). He also tried to bring Carter Scherbius back and eventually transferred some of Carter's memories and consciousness into a new Hilichurl body, creating Caterpillar. After many failures, Jakob finally created a new body for Narzissenkreuz, using Carter's remains and a pocket watch given to Jakob by Alain many years ago representing the time when Rene was around.\nNarzissenkreuz didn't remember his failure and thought that the trial was a great success. <color=#ffffffd9>\"Everything has become consummately clear.

He hired the Eremites to buy the paintings, but Mamere did not want to negotiate with them. When the mercenaries were about to steal the painting, the Traveler intervened and drove them away. Later, the Eremites and Jakob went to Mamere's house in Merusea Village to find her special paints, but even after turning the whole house upside down, they found nothing. It turned out that Mamere's paints were the crystallized blood of the creature from the Abyss, Elynas, inside of whom the Melusines lived. Several centuries after Elynas' death, his heart shrank, and Jakob had to use the power of the Abyss to restart it and collect enough blood. He needed this power to perform the ritual and complete the plans of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, as the Apocalypse calculated by the \"world-formula\" was near. When Jakob reversed the crystallization process with the magic circle, tremors began throughout Elynas's body and the Rifthounds appeared. Jakob tried to get rid of the Traveler but Elynas saved them with the help of his creations — the Breacher Primuses. Elynas was glad that he did not return to life: if his heart began to beat and blood flowed through his veins, all his Melusine daughters would have died.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

He hoped that Narzissenkreuz, who had gone under the tower, would break the seal and take possession of the source of life. Only with the help of the Holy Blade would he be able to continue his unfinished work, gathering the wills of everyone in Fontaine, the continent, and even the entire planet unto himself. As the Primordial Sea would return once more, and as the\nwould darken the sky, only he who had been whole unto himself would survive. The will of all souls, being spared from destruction, would welcome a new dawn in the tranquil sea of innocence he would grant them. The Blade of Will would fall into the waters and be grasped by its legitimate owner to gain the power to combat the apocalypse. To prevent spiritual impurities and contaminants from entering the Narzissenkreuz's space, Jakob even performed the \"Dispelling Ritual\" in the Tower of Gestalt."

        "text": "Scherbius was born more than 500 years ago in a poor family. When something had happened to his entire family, Carter ended up at the Narzissenkreuz Institute, an orphanage in Fontaine. The kind Oceanid Lyris was the Director of the Institute, and the former Admiral of the White Armada Basil Elton was the Vice Director.\nCarter became Alain Guillotin's assistant at the Institute of Natural Philosophy many years later. Alain was a child prodigy, while Carter was considered simple-minded and not very smart, although he was older than Alain. Often, he could not understand Alain's discussions but had always supported the latter's ideas. Although they did not have a particularly warm relationship, since Alain did not like Carter's clumsiness and cared about Khaenri'ahn automatons more than people, Carter still always respected him.\nDuring his work as an assistant, he made some friends. One of them was Rene de Petrichor, another brilliant scientist who became Alain's colleague in some projects, and Jakob Ingold – Rene's younger stepbrother, who was considered a little strange, which brought him closer to Carter. He also met Alain's younger sister, Mary-Ann Guillotin, who Carter admired for her warmth, smile, and kindness. He admired the talents of Alain and Rene and believed that Rene and Jakob, the creators of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, would become very prominent figures in the history of Fontaine. Carter was delighted to learn that Alain, Mary-Ann, Rene, and Jakob were also graduates of the Narzissenkreuz Institute. They talked about their adventures, about Lyris and Basil, which immersed Carter in his childhood memories. Like many graduates of the Institute, Carter dreamed of rebuilding an orphanage that was disbanded and flooded during the Cataclysm 500 years ago.\nDespite not being as talented as Rene and Alain were, Carter proposed creating a clockwork Mek capable of taking pictures. He believed that Alain would regret those moments when he hadn't been with his sister, Mary-Ann, and would want to see how she grew up and changed. Although Alain did not initially approve of the idea, he still saw the benefit of such a development for the Maison Gardiennage for its surveillance purpose. It was Carter's idea that led to the creation of Recon Log Mek – a mechanized dog with a camera on its head. Alain created his first Mek to help Mary-Ann when she began working for the Marechaussee Hunters and named it Seymour. In addition, two automatons were named after Carter, Assault and Suppression Specialist Meks."

After much thought and discussion, Rene proposed this experiment to Carter, to which he agreed. Unfortunately, Elynas's flesh, which had a beneficial effect on Jakob, did not help Carter; it only caused rejection and tissue destruction. Despite his condition, Carter remained alive and could make sounds. Even when Rene removed Carter's vocal cords, they grew back within days.\nUnfortunately, Rene and Jakob could not cure Carter, but they used all their knowledge to bring him back in a different form.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Lanoire could not leave prison and go to her relatives since, according to the papers, she simply did not exist. Having made friends with Lanoire, Caterpillar decided to help the girl escape prison. Their chosen method was the \"Game of the Rich\" – a game invented by the guard Estienne, in which teams competed to collect credit coupons, the special currency used in the Fortress of Meropide. The winning team would be able to travel with Estienne to the surface for periodic checks. Thus, Lanoire could leave prison, and no one would look for her.\nTeaming up with Traveler and Paimon, Caterpillar, and Lanoire were able to defeat the other teams, mainly due to Caterpillar, who had been collecting coupons for years by teaming up with other prisoners. Although the Fortress of Meropide guard, Noailles, tried to interfere with the escape plan, Lanoire, and Caterpillar were still able to escape and go to Lanoire's grandfather, Earnshaw, with the help of Estienne."

Together, they decided to find out the secret of Ann's origin and prevent Narzissenkreuz from carrying out his plan to save humanity from the Apocalypse, dissolving the bodily shell of all people in Fontaine with the help of the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.\nCaterpillar, Traveler, Ann, Seymour, and Paimon searched for materials to forge the original Holy Blade, capable of dividing and uniting the will. It turned out that three of the four materials have already been found by Jakob Ingold, who was trying to implement Narzissenkreuz's plan. He met with the Traveler and others at the Tower of Gestalt, the headquarters of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. This meeting marked the beginning of Doomsday, as all four members were gathered together."

Inside the Book, Caterpillar met \"Puppy,\" which was a memory of Carter Scherbius, just like Caterpillar himself. It said that the world inside the Book was collapsing, but as long as \"Puppy\" appeared in the form of a dog and not a Rifthound, there was still a chance of salvation.\nThe Traveler rescued Caterpillar from this world, but the time spent in the Book left its scars on him. He could no longer take a human form, and his consciousness began to fade. As a farewell, Caterpillar decided to meet Lanoire on her birthday. He thanked Paimon and the Traveler for rescuing him from the Book of Revelation and disappeared, asking Lanoire to tell him her own story someday.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Although Lyris loved children, she did not have outstanding intellectual abilities even for an Oceanid and did not have an understanding of cause and effect, so the Institute was run by Vice-Director Basil Elton.\nWhen the Cataclysm came 500 years ago, she could not understand why the orphanage was destroyed, and her only desire was to return to the time when the children from the orphanage played as the Narzissen champions. She was found, consumed by guilt, by the members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, Rene, and Jakob. Since Lyris had the ability to dissolve and extract people's wills, she became a valuable member of the order, receiving the name \"Red Empress.\"\nWhen Rene dissolved his physical form with the help of Lyris and the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz, the Ordo decided to revive Elynas, the monster of the Abyss, with the help of whose flesh and blood Jakob Ingold fed his powers. Lyris went inside Elynas with Jakob and the Narzissenkreuz's apprentice, Caterpillar. In Elynas, they encountered Marechaussee Hunters, including Mary-Ann Guillotin, who attempted to stop the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. During this battle, Mary-Ann Guillotin was seriously injured, and Lyris hugged her and absorbed her consciousness. A new Oceanid, Mary-Ann, was born from this merge. Mary-Ann was no longer either Lyris or Mary-Ann Guillotin but embodied their shared consciousness and desires and was something beyond human or Oceanid, capable of creating other Oceanids.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
