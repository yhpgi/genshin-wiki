Each Melusine was born with a shard of broken Meks, so they began to consider these objects as their \"tokens,\" which must be protected. Mamere's \"token\" was the artificed clockwork relay module of the mechanical dog Seymour, which was created by Alain Guillotin to protect his sister Mary-Ann Guillotin during Marechaussee Phantom duties. Mamere found Seymour among the wreckage, repaired him, and brought him to her home. Since Mamere possessed a part of this Mek, she could talk to him, although she did not know that the Mek itself was in hibernation mode, playing only pre-recorded phrases.\nWhile all the other Melusines lost the ability to speak with their progenitor and forgot about him, Mamere remained the only one who heard Elynas. In addition, she had a unique vision of art that even her sisters could not understand. For her paintings, Mamere used a special red ore, which, unbeknownst to Mamere, was the crystallized blood of Elynas.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

He sent a group of Eremites to Mamere, and the Traveler saw their meeting. The Traveler drove the mercenaries away, and out of gratitude, Mamere offered to draw a picture. They went to Mamere's home in Merusea Village and met her mechanical dog, Seymour.\nTo draw the picture, Mamere needed a special ore for colors, which could only be mined near Melusines' village. While the Traveler and Paimon were helping Mamere with the ore, the Eremites and Jakob, who had previously tried to buy Mamere's painting, came to her house. Since Mamere refused to give the ore to Jakob, he ordered it to be taken away by force, and during the battle with the Traveler, the mercenaries broke Seymour. Mamere asked the Traveler to help her fix Seymour and sent them to collect special parts. After Seymour was repaired, earthquakes began in the village, and the Melusines' progenitor asked Mamere to save his children.\nIt turned out that Jakob was a member of the secret and radical organization, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, and the first Neohuman. He was trying to revive the petrified heart of Elynas, since he used Elynas's blood to enhance his powers. After the battle with Jakob, Elynas asked Mamere to draw a picture with which he communicated with the Traveler."
