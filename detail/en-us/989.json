The mighty Star Fortress, Anusharwan — designed personally by Princess Gopatha, and named by Emperor Sher — was now nothing more than a fragile egg before the rebel fleet, and mother hen was away from the nest.\nBastinu deftly navigated the Lachsz Clipper through the intricate and winding ventilation system, weaving between jets of poisonous gas and elemental clouds shooting out from holes in the walls, while trying to shake the automatic mechanical sentries on his tail. His eyes and ears filled with blood and the scene before him merged into a continuous blur of color and light as the clipper shot ahead at a breathtaking speed.\n\"Now's my chance.\"\nSo thought Bastinu to himself as the propulsion system's energy core came gradually into view.\n\"It's time.\"\nSo thought Admiral Geldafried to herself as she gazed at the flashing sphere of light in the planet's orbit.\nThen, she gave the order to launch an indiscriminate assault on the planet.\nThen, Bastinu launched a fatal attack on the fortress core.\n\"Oh, what I would give to see the look on Princess Gopatha's face right now...\"\nSo thought both to themselves, separately but identically, in that brief moment."
