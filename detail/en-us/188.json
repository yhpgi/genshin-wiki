If you give this note to Yoimiya, she will be able to make fireworks just as you remember them.<br/>No matter how time passes, or people and things change, so long as you take care of this note, you will stand guard over a door to the past. Perhaps you too will find happiness that belongs only to you under a firework-filled sky.",
