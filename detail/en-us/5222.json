Callas was a very ambitious man who always looked forward, so he dreamed that the development of Spina di Rosula would turn Poisson into a large city, not inferior to the splendor of the Court of Fontaine. Callas was famous for his stubbornness and coldness, and Clementine was always cheerful. Callas managed the affairs of the organization and expanded its sphere of influence, while Clementine took care of the relationships and atmosphere within Spina di Rosula. Together they complemented each other's characters, and thanks to their efforts, Spina di Rosula grew and prospered.\nSpina di Rosula is now strapped for cash, so they conduct much of their operations at their headquarters in the Fleuve Cendre.

When the construction of the lines was discussed, Spina di Rosula was divided into two parties. Callas believed that the organization had a rare opportunity to establish cooperation with the authorities of the Court of Fontaine and the Research Institute and that the construction of the lines would help to establish useful connections. The aquabuses were supposed to bring commercial benefits and a good reputation among the residents of Fontaine. The second party, led by Spina di Rosula member Romeuf, thought that such significant sums would be better invested in the development of Poisson. When the parties could not agree, Romeuf and his supporters harbored a grudge against Callas and Clementine, considering her biased because of her pregnancy. For Romeuf's group, Clementine's support for the construction of the lines was a betrayal, meaning their voices would never be heard again. After Clementine died due to complications during the birth of her daughter, Callas began to view the construction of lines as the embodiment of her last will. Then the last hope of compromise disappeared, so Romeuf left Spina di Rosula."

Although the organization's home is Poisson, none of the lines lead into the town, and only the Clementine line passes through the Mont Automnequi. The Callas line leading from the Court of Fontaine to the Research Institute was destroyed when the Institute's Central Laboratory exploded, but Navia plans not only to restore it and add additional stops on existing lines but also build the fourth line to the Lumidouce Harbor.\nMany years later, when the daughter of Clementine and Callas, Navia, became the head of the organization, Romeuf decided to take revenge on Spina di Rosula and blow up the Clementine line passing over Poisson. His assistant Colter, who had recently left the Fortress of Meropide, blamed all the troubles that happened to Spina di Rosula on Navia, because of whom, in his opinion, Clementine, Callas, and the former butler Melus died. He believed that Navia destroyed everything dear to him with her own hands and brought Poisson to destruction. Navia was able to defeat Colter in a fight, and the Traveler and Paimon defused the bombs and saved the line from destruction.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

In addition, a few years ago in Poisson, a certain Sinthe began to gain popularity — a drink that could excite your mood and produce many pleasant hallucinations. With long-term use of Sinthe, many side effects occurred, including a loss of the ability to focus or control one's emotions. Upon withdrawal, the person experienced flashes of paranoia and anxiety while lacking the energy to do anything. Sinthe itself was the diluted water of the Primordial Sea which was capable of dissolving the Fontainians due to origin as the Oceanids."

Realizing that the enemy was smart, Callas decided to secretly establish contact with the sellers and build personal relationships with them. Eventually, he managed to convince one man, Jacques, to become his informant. Jacques was ashamed of his work after seeing the effects of Sinthe, so he agreed to help Callas. One evening, Callas held a banquet at a countryside estate, where he planned to exchange information with Jacques. Suddenly, two shots were heard, and on the spot, people found Callas holding a gun in his hands and Jacques dead on the ground. For lack of other evidence, Callas was accused of murder and called \"Callas the Unfaithful.\" At his trial, he chose a duel and refused to surrender, resulting in his death. When the president of Spina di Rosula was accused of murder, the organization lost its influence.\nCallas had discovered the connection between Sinthe and the case of the missing women long before that evening. According to the information received, the next victim was supposed to be Navia, Callas's daughter, and he could not stay away. Knowing that due to an incurable illness, he did not have enough time to complete the investigation he had begun, Callas decided to take extreme measures. He stated that he had important evidence in his hands, incriminating the criminals and known to members of Spina di Rosula. But as long as his daughter was safe, the evidence would not be made public. Since Callas was afraid that something would threaten his daughter, he did not deny his guilt in the murder of Jacques and chose to die on a Duelists' Ring. Before his death, he shared the location of the Sinthe factory with Melus.\nThree years after the death of her father, Navia took up the investigation of the case of the missing women and the case of her father. Having received new evidence, she and her partners, the Traveler and Paimon, realized that there could be a third person in Callas's case, who was dissolved by the Primordial waters. After multiple checks and investigations, the list of the suspects was reduced to three people close to Spina di Rosula: Florent, a senior adviser to the organization; Marcel, head of the Confrerie of Cabriere; and Thierry, responsible for the coordination and exchange of information between Spina di Rosula and the Gardes. As a result of the investigation, it turned out that Marcel, whom Navia considered her family, was behind the disappearance of the women, Sinthe, and Jacques's murder. Thanks to the efforts of the Traveler, Paimon, and Navia, the criminal was found, and the Fontainians were able to live in safety again.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

When the Traveler and Paimon escaped, they found Sonny and his partner, Luca, who were looking for Virgil. Together, they found the shipment of Sinthe, which Virgil and his henchmen were trying to sell. After \"a long and very serious chat with him,\" Virgil has never been seen again.\nOnce, members of Spina di Rosula, Turner and Hunter, buried Henri, who unknowingly became involved with Fatui and broke the mechanisms that he believed were destroying the environment in the sand. In reality, these devices were used by the Fontaine Research Institute to monitor and optimize water quality, and their cores recorded all of Fontaine's hydrological data. Thanks to the help of the Traveler, the mechanisms were restored, Fatuus was neutralized, and Turner and Hunter hired Henri to work.\nWhen Navia heard rumors that someone was scheming against Melusines and that Neuvillette and the Traveler were investigating the case, she asked Spina di Rosula to keep an eye out for leads. Then she \"invited\" the suspects for coffee, and they couldn't refuse, which probably meant that the Spina had threatened them. Although the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and the Marechaussee Phantom know about Spina di Rosula's methods, they don't interfere.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
