A long time ago, Natlan's Ley Lines were damaged, and so one of the angels, the Lord of the Night, created the Night Kingdom, recreating a network similar to the Ley Lines. After this, the first Pyro Archon and the Ruler of Death created the laws of the Ode of Resurrection, which made it impossible for Natlan's Ley Lines to connect with the Ley Lines of other countries. The Heavenly Principles changed them so that they could withstand the Abyss. When the Night Kingdom was corrupted by the Abyss, it could no longer contain the souls of all the dead, and they wandered the earth in torment. After seeing many homeless souls during the Cataclysm, he abandoned the idea of knowledge and began using his heart as a vessel for souls. The Sentinel Knight kept the souls of hundreds of his fallen comrades and Natlanese in his heart, but he could not find a way to put them to rest. When the souls merged, their voices echoed in his head, never ceasing for a second. Souls that retained the memories of their deaths cried, screamed, and moaned desperately. Because of these screams, Thrain knew no moment of peace and could not sleep for five hundred years of his immortality. Due to these trials, his body succumbed to erosion and decay, but he did not retreat from his intended purpose for a moment. Thrain tried to put the souls stored in his heart to rest in many countries, but not a single attempt was successful. The unique structure of the Ley Lines in Natlan later led Capitano there, since it was the only land capable of resting the souls he carried within himself.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

With Natlan's time running out and heroes not yet recognized by their Ancient Names, Capitano knew this plan was too risky. If the heroes of Natlan did not arrive in time, not only Natlan, but all of Teyvat would pay for this mistake."

The Cryo Archon allows every Harbinger the freedom to pursue the meaning of their existence, even if that freedom can take precedence over her orders. Capitano's methods were radically different from some other Harbingers' methods despite sharing the same goal. Upon learning that the Traveler, the brother/sister of the Princess/Prince of Khaenri'ah, had arrived in Natlan, the Harbinger attempted to ally with them to help Natlan, but they refused. To find another way to restore the Ley Lines, the Fatui began studying the Source Mechanisms, a technology used by the ancient dragons to strengthen and empower the Ley Lines. This method was of little use in the time of the dragons, as they lacked the skills to navigate the intricate structure of the Ley Lines. Like using the Gnosis, this method required the sacrifice of everything contained within the existing Ley Lines: memories, souls, and history. Upon learning of the Fatui's plan, the Pyro Archon called for all forces to mobilize to destroy the Source Mechanism and prevent it from being activated. When Mavuika, the Traveler, and the heroes of Natlan found the mechanism, Capitano and Ororon activated it but were stopped. When activated, the Source Mechanism did not restore the Ley Lines but awakened the Lord of the Night from her slumber. Although the activation was incredibly painful, the Lord of the Night was able to absorb some of the power into herself, allowing her to speak and help the Natlanese. She was willing to restore the Ley Lines at the cost of her life, but this would destroy the rules of Natlan and leave the country vulnerable to an attack from the Abyss in the future.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Memory and love were the supplies she brought, and they would help see her through confusion and solitude.\nWithin a world created through meditation, she would manifest this path. A high tower would appear in the distance, the Sacred Flame burning at its summit, lighting her way and showing her the path.\nNone knew how to get there, nor how far the journey would take her, but as her luggage grew ever lighter, the road stretched ever farther on with each step she took.\nFarewell, Atea said to her, and Tenoch, and her mother and sister.\nFarewell, Sundjatta told her, and Burkina and Wanjiru also.\nThe existence of the path to victory was not something to be taken for granted. Rather, it was forged by countless heroes, past and present. Rather than a \"savior,\" then, Mavuika preferred to be known as an \"agent.\"\nBut this alone was not enough. Her journey was no penance that required only willpower, but rather, decisiveness and wisdom also.\nShe could never have foreseen such marked variables as the Traveler or The Captain five hundred years prior, but upon learning of them, she only needed a moment's consideration before deciding to incorporate them into the plan.\nIn addition to any other considerations she might have had based on the realities of the situation, another factor played into her judgment — that both the Traveler and The Captain exhibited traits that mirrored her own.\nWere it not for their respective positions, she would have liked nothing more than for the three of them to sit and speak of their travels over grilled meat and drinks. After all, those who travel along the same road, never having a fixed residence, can best resonate with and understand one another.\nBut she also had a deep understanding of the obstacles therein — having traveled so far, it was only natural to not wish to show the fatigue or weakness in one's heart, and even she was no exception.\nShe could easily tell stories about her comrades or family with a smile, but rarely could she speak of the sadness sown in the river of time by those happy moments, nor could she take out her long-emptied haversack, point at it, and speak of how it reflected the current state of her heart.\nShe could not, she would not, and she did not need to.\nSo, in the end, she kept a suitable distance, just as she always has. Everyone needed the ringing cheers and flowing wine of victory feasts, just as they needed the solitary quiet once the revelry faded.\nIn this era, perhaps only one person would ever inappropriately knock on her door in those peaceful moments, and that was Citlali.\nPerhaps it was her fondness for drink? Or maybe they just made suitable drinking buddies."

The soldiers themselves did not hold back — it was clear they were already aware that he was working with their commander. The things they talked about were of no particular importance, yet they spoke and laughed freely, showing no restraint on account of his presence. After asking his age, one soldier even handed him a cup of a colorless drink they called \"Fire-Water.\"\nAfter a cautious sip, he proceeded to down it in one gulp, just as he had seen the soldiers do, receiving a loud cheer in response. For some reason, he felt a lot better after doing this.\nThe soldiers around him chatted about trivial matters, every now and then breaking into songs they all knew. Ororon did not have much to add, so he simply sat there, either watching the fire before them or the sky high above. It felt so far from the ground, the individual stars like tiny white kernels, together like mist. \"Astral Mist,\" he suddenly thought to himself. Not a bad name...\nLater, he would learn that not all Fatui soldiers were like this. The ones he met were elite soldiers led by the First Harbinger, older veterans with experience and firm moral standards. Beyond this company, however, there were many others who were younger than he was, others whose actions would leave his brows well and truly furrowed.\nBut on that windless night, with the stars so clearly visible in the sky, he had not yet been troubled by such knowledge. He simply let go of his worries, enjoying the friendly company and the cup of strange-tasting liquor he had been given.\nThere would never be another night like this. He sensed it then — just like how, when he considered accepting a second drink, he was firmly stopped by The Captain. Though he seemed completely normal after the first cup and potentially could really hold his liquor, yet all the same, some places are best not delved into too deeply.\nBut clearly, Ororon was not exactly the obedient type. Later, he discreetly tracked down the soldier who had handed him that drink and asked him how to brew Fire-Water himself. If he ever managed to make a batch clear enough to reflect the night sky, he'd name the first bottle \"Astral Mist.\""

But after personally inviting Mika to spar, he concluded that Mika's current abilities were \"remarkable, but far from enough.\"\nMika didn't figure out what that meant until the expedition team entered a dangerous restricted area, where he finally saw with his own eyes the monsters Grand Master Varka had used as a reference when judging his powers.\nThose unnamable, wandering creatures could become a nightmare for any knight unfortunate enough to stray away from the team.\nThe speed of their scouts in the vanguard determined how fast the whole expedition team proceeded, so during the days when the team was the busiest, Mika could only rest for half an hour a day.\nIt was Mika's first time working under such high pressure, and he did so with great difficulty. Not to mention that apart from dangers of the unknown, the expedition team was under the watchful gaze of another party...\nOne day, when Mika was getting ready to call it a night, he received a warning from another scout that the Knights had encountered enemies.\nWhen Mika hurried on scene, Varka had already drawn up battle lines with his trusty subordinates.\nIn the depths of the pitch-dark night, Mika could vaguely make out a line of soldiers, silently standing there as if they were lifeless war machines.\nAnd right in the middle of the enemy formation was a dark, distinct silhouette. Even though torches lit the area, Mika could see nothing but their eerily dark blue eyes that seemed to glow with an uncanny aura.\nAt his teammate's reminder, Mika learned of their identity — the Fatui Harbinger known as \"The Captain\" and his direct, elite subordinates.\nAs it turned out, their vanguard had bumped into Fatui scouts and an altercation had ensued, resulting in both sides getting jumpy and continuously requesting reinforcements, eventually alerting their respective commanders.\nThe scent of gunpowder was thick in the air, the sense of crisis turned Mika's limbs numb and cold.\nHe couldn't help visualizing the confrontation escalating into an armed conflict, and what he should do if such a thing were to happen...\nThe Harbinger, in particular — Mika knew that he would be utterly helpless to parry a single half-hearted swipe from this person.\nHis jumbled thoughts and exhaustion made it difficult to breathe or focus.\nVarka, however, seemed completely unfazed. He greeted the Harbinger from afar and walked towards him with his weapon in hand. The Captain, too, signaled his men to stand by as he began slowly stepping forward.\nAs the tension between the two parties reached its peak, Varka and The Captain briefly conversed and seemed to reach an agreement.\nThe dark silhouette raised his arm, and the ghostly shadows of the Fatui soldiers silently turned and departed with him.\nThe Knights all heaved a sigh of relief, and some were even trembling with fear. But when Varka returned to the Knights' formation, he looked as relaxed as ever.\n\"Well, that was a surprise! If it weren't for our unique circumstances, I would've loved to invite him for a duel!\"\n\"And it's not like he's a stubborn fellow. He's well aware that engaging in battle in a strange and foreign land would've been disadvantageous for both of us.\"\nIt was until then that Mika realized they had been on the precipice of war, and conflict had been avoided only because the Grand Master had been there to prevent it.\nThe Captain's overpowering presence and the calmness with which Grand Master Varka handled the crisis both left a profound impression in Mika's mind.\nMika reflected on this experience for a long time and concluded that although he had been improving in strength, he still had a long way to go when it came to dealing with situations like that.\nThere was more to be done than just doing his best to help the team. He had to work harder to become a reliable Knight who could handle all manner of incidents..."
