I know you have a pure heart, always speaking honest words and doing earnest deeds. So, I ask you to keep our upcoming plans in strict confidence, with true heart and kinship.\"\nSanhaj, unaware of his brother's sinister plan, nodded and agreed.\n\"Alright then. I'll tell you my plan, but you must cooperate with me and not reveal it to anyone.\"\nSo, Kompore began to slowly unveil his wicked scheme:\n\"I want you to visit the Lord of the Crossroads. Claim that I am on the brink of death, and say that you hope to obtain Papa Witch Doctor's medicine to cure my illness. While that is happening, I will infiltrate his hut and steal his mushroom wine. With it, we can grant more wisdom to our tribe and eliminate more of its troubles.\"\n\"Think it over, would you, dear brother? Just imagine how much our tribe would gain from obtaining that wine â€” not to mention how much we'd both benefit!\"\nThe younger brother had wanted to refuse, but having rashly agreed to his brother's first request, he could only consent to Kompore's sinister plot.\nOf course, this is merely Kompore's own account. Why did he cast himself as a villain who betrayed his brother, and is this story truly or falsely told? Yet, since he has become a tribal hero, very few dare to investigate further."
