I am well aware of the ban laid upon us by the Golden Hunter, who bade us not to embroil ourselves in the squabbles of that great city, lest our blades be stained with the blood of our brethren.\nFriends, children of Remuria, my compatriots, please, lend me your ears! To uphold justice is our goal, not the shackles that bind us.\nBut if you look upon that sea of bitterness, yet desire not to stain your noble names, then from this day forth let me be a Walter no longer — let me be sundered from our Hunt.\nThus did a scion of the empire once again make war upon the descendants of those who ruled the High Sea's northern regions,\nBut this time, the blood of those who aforetime were invaders now stood on the side of the poor.\nForsaking the longsword that was the Golden Hunter's heritage, he wielded now a shortbow disdained by his peers,\nAnd like a shadow, he stalked between the high halls, using blood to paint the gallows-noose of judgment.\nThis slender hunter was ill-suited to facing monsters head-on, but proved adept at slaying the wicked.\nThe blood-stained feasts of black gold often had clamor for their wine, and the princes of the day did not shy from conflict or chaos,\nYet the sudden silence and orderly omen of death would bring its victims the greatest terror...\n...\nPerhaps it was pure pragmatism at play, then, that the techniques that had silently ended so many noble lives,\nThe archery meant to pierce the throats of the oppressors, the steps meant to evade pursuit...\nNone of them would be lost, not even after the traitor to the house of Walter was executed, then exonerated amidst the games of the purple-clothed,\nBeing celebrated in sponsored operas as the Executioner of the Phantom Hunters, an idol defanged and harmless.\nInstead, as per the will of those in power, those techniques were practiced by Hunters in ages thereafter,\nUntil thousands of years later, in the Siege of Poisson, when their use caused a river to run red with the blood of those they had once been pledged to defend..."
