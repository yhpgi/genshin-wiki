Let my name be engulfed by the flaming beacons and the burning winds.\"\n\"The old pact shall be broken, and in its place you will establish a new one, bringing them true peace.\"\n\"Until the day we meet once more, my most loyal servant Dinga, dragon slayer and fated Sovereign Maghan.\"\n\"Hero of mine, and mine alone, this is my final command.

Please permit me to retire on account of this.\"\nThis was the origin of Mictlan, one of the six great tribes in the thousand years to come.\nAs for how, when the Cinder City fell, the priest Maghan's successor renewed the pact with the dragons,\nAnd how, according to his wishes, he was buried amongst unmarked graves, rather than being returned to the Sacred Flame;\nThat is another story altogether, completely unrelated to Maghan the dragon slayer.\n\"I dream of a katun without fear... the city of jade shall be established where the sun rises, and a new lord shall be born twice.\"\n\"The golden emissary shall come, the green bird shall come, Aq're Q'aq shall come. It is the promise of the night.\"\n\"I dream of your descendants... free from fears of smoke and phantasms, no longer in tears, no longer in pain.\"\n\"The master of flames and blazing infernos... will protect the dreams of humans and dragons alike, watching over them until the stars cease to turn.\"\n\"Hero of mine, and mine alone, this is my final vision.
