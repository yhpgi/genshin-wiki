Weightless, like the light that pierces light.\"\n\"Untouchable, moving like a snake. Inescapable, as sword's stare and polearm's glance.\"\nThe Rainslasher was named out of reverence for its master. Originally it had no name.\nThe blade's first and final master was a martial nomad who went by the name of Guhua.\nIt is said that he was an adeptus. While Guhua lived, bandits dared not act and the wilderness knew a peace like that of the city.\nAllegedly, at the end of his journey he ascended in a purple haze and became a star.\nOne to whom Guhua had shown kindness founded what is now known as the Guhua School in his honor. But no school is destined to last forever."
