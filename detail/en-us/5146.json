Those rules named the Mosso Protocols required Curve to answer all questions with complete accuracy and honesty, excluding the possibility of lying. The researcher's true goal was to create a machine that would gradually become human by understanding lies and humanity. If Curve would learn to lie like humans one day, it would mean that he was no longer bound by his machine programming and had acquired human emotions. Not long after the existence of Dr. Mosso's lie detector was made public, The Steambird published several articles on it and quickly drew the people's attention. The paper used special features to incite widespread fear and worry among the general public, and soon, public opinion began to turn against Lombroso. People started to worry about what would happen if a suspect in a trial isn't lying, but Curve says he is; or how to guarantee that the lie detector's output is credible. Finally, The Steambird provided evidence that exposed Dr. Mosso as having falsified results, and this evidence was key to the researcher's conviction. To save his creation, Mosso Lombroso died defending himself in a court duel."

He thought this lesson on dynamic evolution could surely guide his machine to another level of comprehension, and in separating truth from fiction. Curve would have eventually surpassed a machine's rules. Dr. Mosso even modified the Mosso Protocols hundreds of times. He forged the evidence and gave it to the newspaper, so he would take all the heat. Thirty years later, newspaper editor Jenck learned from the Fatui agent, who was involved in the kidnapping of Sir Arthur, that the newspaper had published false accusations that led to the scientist's death. Jenck had no regrets for the doctor but decided to take advantage of the situation and reveal the truth so that people would sue the newspaper the same way it had sued Dr. Mosso. Then the Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie would have problems, and Jenck could take her place. People would remember him as a fearless fighter for justice who solved such a high-profile case."

Long ago, the editor made a deal with the Fatui agents, led by one of the Harbingers, that he would find them Mosso's research, and in return, they would help him lead The Steambird. In the laboratory, Jenck took possession of instructions for turning on the self-destruction system and, in order to stop the Traveler, turned it on before escaping. They could neither open the doors nor get through the pipeline, otherwise an explosion would have occurred. Curve tried to calculate the probability of saving Talochard, Paimon, and the Traveler, but his calculations did not bring positive results. He then revealed that he could disable the self-destruction system by placing his core in the control room to unlock the security room. He knew that his core was rapidly aging, and he would soon go into hibernation mode, so he decided to trick Talochard into saving her. The self-destruct system could not be turned off, and as soon as Talochard and the others were in the emergency exit, an explosion occurred, and the entire laboratory was flooded. Although Curve died in the explosion, he finally fulfilled his creator's dream and broke the Mosso Protocols. The Fatui are now looking for Curve's remains and the data stolen from Dr. Mosso's laboratory.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The Remurians reached heights that were challenging to attain in study and differentiation of the spirit. Spirit was divided into memory, wishes, soul, and persona. Among these, the state that came closest to the perfect freedom that divinities possessed was named \"True Will.\" The detachment of human will with such meticulous research as a jumping-off point. Upon learning of this, Rene decided that separating a person's will could be the key to salvation from the prophecy. If the God King Remus created imperishable bodies of stone and bronze for the Remurians, then Rene wanted to create Neohumans and separate the will of the Fontainians in order to wait out the apocalypse and escape fate. At the Narzissenkreuz Institute, Rene discovered the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz, capable of uniting and concentrating the will of many people.

About 450 years ago, all four Orthants were built by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. Even before the founding of the order, their leader, Rene de Petrichor, discovered the records of the Golden Troupe. He learned about \"Fortuna\" and that kingdoms rise and fall, and when a civilization is annihilated, a new one will be born after from the ashes. This phenomenon turned out to be similar to Rene's computational scheme, called the \"world-formula.\" After countless calculations, he found a discrepancy with Fortuna: unlike the world depicted in these ancient texts, there will be no more new civilizations born. Like the ancient Remurians, Rene wanted to escape fate and avoid the promised Apocalypse, so he founded the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.

This knowledge of the order was also gleaned from the records of the Remurian Harmosts. They wanted to create an object endowed with meaning, the essence of which would be determined only by Quality.

In such a world, even sweet flowers and mint would not grow. For the first time, the Traveler and Paimon entered the world inside the book through the Book of Revelations itself, hidden inside the body of the petrified creature, Elynas. One of the Melusines tried to decipher this book, and for her, the subspace seemed like a beautiful garden.

Many years ago, she became the only one who was ready to teach medicine to a Melusine. The children called this traveling doctor \"the witch,\" and the witch taught Sigewinne how to make all kinds of potions and the art of using ghost stories to scare children into taking medicine. One day, Sigewienne, the Melusine she taught, became friends with a girl, but when she fell ill, her parents forbade the Melusine from coming to cure her, because they did not trust the species, which was different from them. Sometime before that, the \"witch\" discovered a strange illness that manifested itself in the dissolution of the human body (this \"illness\" was explained by the origin of the Fontainians from the Oceanids, so the water of the Primordial Sea returned them to their origin). Even after using herself as an experimental subject, she was stumped and could not find an answer on how to cure this illness, but she made a discovery: by mixing this liquid with some specific ingredients, she received a face-changing solution usable by Fontainians alone."

Although the Melusine did not know about her teacher's research, she accepted her parting gift and created a new appearance for herself, more similar to a human. Only many years later, when Fontaine's prophecy about the dissolution of people came true, Sigewinne opened the sealed letter from the \"witch\" and learned the whole truth, that the woman sacrificed herself to help the Melusine.

This opinion quickly spread throughout Teyvat, and people who adhered to it began to call themselves \"The Unchained.\" Some specifically bought fish for this purpose, and merchants realized that they could make a profit from it. They started smuggling various animals from all over and used strange feed to make them look more beautiful, before selling them off to members of The Unchained at exorbitant prices. One of Jala's cases involved a criminal who had released invasive fish into Fontaine waters on the east coast of the Fort Charybdis Ruins. With the help of Jala and the Traveler, officer of the Maison Gardiennage, Enghiene, who had already met with the Traveler in the Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta and in the Swordmaster case, found the criminal who was threatening the safety of Fontaine's ecosystem and the quality of the famous Fonta.\nIn this subarea, the world quests"
