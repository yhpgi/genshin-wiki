It is said to be a gift from a firework artisan intending to show their respect for the Yanshang Teahouse's new owner. Since she took over the place, almost all the problem gamblers have disappeared. The game of cards no longer has anything to do with Mora, instead returning to its original and purest form â€” ordinary leisure-time amusement.</p>",
