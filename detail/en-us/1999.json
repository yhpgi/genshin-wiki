It is time to set sail.\"\n\"Well then, let's show those Shogunate lackeys Seirai's strength!\"\nHearing the sea shanties greeting their departure, the shrine maiden set down her warbow.\nShe once secretly learned true \"magic\" on Mt. Yougou,\nAnd though she felt sorry for her Master, the Tengu, she would use it here.\nShe would undo the great barrier that had held for a thousand years,\nAnd she would set the resentment of the moribund violet glede free,\nAllowing it to ravage the ships that flew the Electro Archon's banner.\nShe could only hope that that old cat wouldn't come charging into the storm..."
