The Guardian that she awaited never came, and so she went alone to the Cave of Eerie Murmurs, never to return. Although the princess's action was brave, Cimest could not agree with it: the princess should not have simply waited, consigning the kingdom to an unknown fate. She should have taken the initiative by calling upon her people to unite as one, seeking out this Guardian together. Then, even if she could not avert the evil fate, at least she would know that she had done everything she could.

The Aerial Express leads to the starry sky from the Astral Garden. It is believed that the new residents of Simulanka go to Constellation Metropole to listen to the prophecies of the Goddess with the help of the Oracle Pillars, but in her last prophecy, she told the residents to refuse her gift — a special magic that protects the residents of the Metropole. This magic allowed them to return to their path for those whose lives had gone off the rails. When the king of the Metropole turned the gears connected to the starry sky, the Goddess's gift disappeared, and the residents gained complete freedom of action.\nWhen the people of Teyvat were able to visit Simulanka, the Astrologist Mona Megistus saw a statue of the Goddess of Prophecy. Although she could not accept that her mentor could look like that, she recognized her incredible ability and the well-deserved title of Trismegistus. When Mona came to Simulanka, she looked at the stars' reflection and saw that Simulanka was an image of the real world, as if the creator made this world inside a mirror, or a lake, and this world is the reflection. The more she scryed, the more familiar her mentor's \"handwriting\" became."

The three true guardians of history, chosen by the three great clans of the kingdom, Cappet, Albizzi, and Boborano, have been arguing for many years about the true history of the past and have been waiting for the arrival of a person who can extract a stuck clockwork key. This key was located in the cave of the future marquis and was the main axis around which the past and present of Constellation Metropole revolved. Each clan adhered to its own version of the clan's origin and the defeated evil dragon of old. The three guardians wanted to find out who rid the Metropole of the evil dragon in order to choose the Supreme Clan. No one could extract the key until the mysterious voice of the narrator led the Traveler, Paimon, and the Komaniya Express courier, nekomata Kirara, to the key. When Kirara found herself in Simulanka, she thought that she had incurred the wrath of some powerful youkai and had been consumed by it, so she wandered around the city trying to find her way home. She found a strange place where the guardians of the clans lived. When the Traveler pulled out the clockwork key, they became the Honorary Marquis."

According to legend, after a fierce battle that lasted many days and nights, the ancestors finally drove away the evil dragon. Together, they turned the clockwork key, which rewound time, so that the past would repeat itself. The manuscript of the great mage, which told how everything really happened and outlined the plan for the creation of the world, was at the very beginning of the rack and on the first page of the book. It is said that in the beginning, the Goddess of Creation took the Goddess of Fate's manuscript as a blueprint, placed it under the Goddess of Prophecy's starry realm, and generated the world from a few magic arrays. So, a few moments later, when the great clockwork key turned time around the guardians to the very beginning, they were able to restore the magic arrays back to their original configurations. The manuscript they found told of Cappet's ancestor, Francois, who gathered the villagers and went to fight the evil dragon. The brave men refused under the protection of the \"Radiant Charter\" of the Goddess herself, so the dragon was unable to use fire and claws. After several days of fighting, the dragon became weak and decided to surrender."

The pedestal for the clockwork key in the place of the yellow Boborano clan was hidden behind a door that opened after solving three riddles. The Boborano clan outwitted the evil dragon of old and took possession of his treasures, so all the clan's valuables, including the pedestal, were kept behind the door. The Honorary Marquis was able to solve the riddles, and it turned out that the story of the yellow clan was also true. The Goddess's manuscript told of Boborano's ancestor, Antonio, who, thanks to his wisdom, defeated the dragon. He was also protected by the \"Radiant Charter,\" so the dragon could not use force if Antonio refused to fight. Antonio offered the dragon to measure their strength in riddles. The toy man won and demanded a reward equal to the price of the dragon's life, minus 1 Mora, and compensation for the burned house in the amount of 1 Mora. He demanded that the dragon burn him, but the dragon asked for mercy and said to ask for anything. Then the wise Antonio made a contract with him and took possession of the treasures of the evil dragon.\nThe manuscript obtained from the sacred place of Albizzi's blue clan told about the ancestors, Alberto and Galileo. They thought that the huge dragon did not notice the little people, so they drank a potion to increase their size and went to talk to the evil dragon. Since the magic cider made them larger than the dragon, he was very scared of them and tried to run away, but Galileo dragged him back by the tail. After a long conversation, Alberto and Galileo were convinced that they had reached an understanding and went home."

The detective suggested that Cappet could have bashed his head against the toilet bowl before leaving the house, so he suddenly collapsed while walking on the street. Kirara and the Traveler didn't believe that Cappet was faking it, so they used the clockwork key to rewind time. Their investigation showed that the detective was not only the culprit but also the mysterious narrator who had been guiding them all this time. He was one of the first intelligent beings created by the Goddess of Creation, and he had long known that their entire world was a fairy tale written by the Goddess of Fate."

The villagers tried to chase the dragon away and protect the village: they grabbed chairs, tables, forks, and spoons so that he would disappear faster.\nWhen the Traveler and Paimon went to look for an island near the toytanium mines to hang a lantern for a lighthouse, it turned out that the tree on the island was not high enough. On the island, they met the toy man Panuelle, who planted this tree, and he suggested that they go to the Whispering Isle and give a gift to the Goddess living there so that she would fulfill the wish of the giver. Panuelle himself once made a wish that the traveler Chauvigne would always remain his friend. In the past, he and Chauvigne would tend the tree together, drink tea, and talk, but one day, Chauvigne went on a journey and returned as a different person. He became more and more strange, muttering strange words and feeling sad. The oldest of the ancient legends in the village says that the Goddess always favored the brave. To fulfill a wish, the brave man only needed to have a gift confirming his courage, so Panuelle took the dragon scale that had fallen into the mines and made a wish. The statue of the Goddess began to shine brightly, but Chauvigne did not change."

It contains the unfinished manuscripts of the Goddess of Fate and the items that the\nused to decorate the Golden Apple Archipelago to invite her daughter there for a vacation, and that were in the Veluriyam Mirage, where The Goddess's friend lives.\n<color=#ffffffd9>Long, long ago, in an era when the mountains were filled with precious treasures, the stars were joined together in long snakes, and the dreams of the night abounded in color...</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>There was a little white stoat (or a white mouse, or a white rabbit perhaps? Never mind, that can be decided later!) who lived in this prosperous and tranquil town. All her friends and neighbors called her \"Snowflake\" (what was her original name... I'll have to decide that later too!).</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Snowflake had a coat of pure white fur, as white as the never-melting snow atop a mountain peak, without a single blemish to be seen. Her eyes sparkled with the silent brilliance of the night sky, and her voice was bright and clear, as if a pair of invisible hands were playing upon a fine instrument, or as though someone was pouring pale golden wine into a glass...</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>All the townspeople wished to see her every day, even if just to say hello.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>But overwhelmed by the people's adulation, and bedazzled by shining jewels, \"Snowflake\" forgot herself... even abandoning her original name. (Aha! Problem solved!)</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>What about my greeting gift? said Ms. Snowflake, too lazy to open the door fully, with naught but the ruby bracelet on her slender wrist shining brightly through the crack.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Uhh... A troubled look came over the visitor's face.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>And with a \"bang,\" the little door was shut once more.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>The pure, noble, and highly revered Ms. Snowflake returned to her dressing table to await the coming of her next \"sincere\" admirer.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Her dream was to find herself the perfect husband.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>But clearly, only someone who already possessed the most precious treasure in the world could possibly be deserving of her hand in marriage...</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>That day, a certain wandering Mr. Cat paid a visit to their town. He came from a faraway kingdom in the north, and wore a coat of thick, well-groomed fur — perhaps you might even say over-groomed, in fact, for if you got close, you could even smell what he had eaten for his last meal (my cat is currently sitting on top of me, licking itself... has a really fishy smell...). There was a wisdom in his emerald-green eyes that was beyond anything common folk could hope to attain.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>The kind-hearted townspeople welcomed the traveler warmly. Within the time it took him to drink three cups of ale, he had already heard about all the town's noteworthy goings-on, and no less than five different weather forecasts for the following day.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Among all the news, what most interested him was that relating to \"Snowflake.\"</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Where may I meet this beautiful lady?</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Ahh... If I was you, I wouldn't bother.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Why is that?</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Ms. Snowflake has a penchant for rare treasures. Over the past two years, she has become more and more... particular. Unless you are in the possession of vast wealth already, you may as well give up on the idea sooner rather than later, for your own good.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Hearing that, Mr. Cat's green eyes twinkled.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Knock knock knock.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Mr. Cat knocked on Ms. Snowflake's door. To him, her house seemed a little on the small side.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>My greeting gift?</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>A pair of listless eyes looked out at Mr. Cat through a crack in the door.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Of course. I have prepared the most magnificent gift for the esteemed Ms. Snowflake, which I trust will only make you more beautiful than you already are. This necklace is inlaid with agate from the north, pearls from the southern seas, and amber from the west — it is my clan's great treasure. Entrusted by my elders, I have traveled the world in search of the most beautiful, noble person to present it to. It is a great honor to meet you, Ms. Snowflake. I believe that you must be the one I seek. Please, accept my gift.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>A flash of dazzling color shined out from the crack in the door as the reflection of the opulent necklace sparkled in Ms. Snowflake's eyes.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Not bad, not bad. Just about up to my standards, said Ms. Snowflake proudly.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>After meeting you, I am now convinced that all jewelry will pale in comparison with your unparalleled beauty. But please, allow me to help you put it on. Mr. Cat bowed sincerely, then took a step inside, nearly getting stuck in the cracked-open door as he did so.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>I will now perform a ceremony of blessing and prayer for you, that this gift might still shine as brightly as the moonlight once I am gone.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Please, go ahead.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Intoxicated by his praise, Ms. Snowflake exposed her flawless alabaster neck...</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>...</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>From that day forth, no one ever saw Ms. Snowflake again.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Some said she had grown tired of the mundanity of life in the town, and set out on a journey to find treasure alone...</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Whereas others were convinced that she had finally found the husband she'd been waiting for, living happily ever after with that Mr. Cat from afar.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>For someone, passing Mr. Cat as he left town, caught a whiff of Ms. Snowflake's delicate perfume on his fur coat.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>(Hmm... Maybe this story isn't suitable for children either? I'll have to think it over...)</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
