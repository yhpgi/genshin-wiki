Be it a knowledgeable researcher or a mercenary who's seen true brutality — everyone is attracted here by Nilou's gorgeous, dancing form.\nEvery time Nilou takes the stage, a press of people crowds the Grand Bazaar until all are standing shoulder to shoulder.\nRational sense and wisdom are the mainstream in Sumeru, while art, which stands for sensibility, does not enjoy the same popularity and respect.\nYet if wisdom is meaning bestowed upon Sumeru by the goddess, then art stands for meaning that human beings seek for themselves."

His wonderful ingenuity always makes people want to buy his merchandise.\nMr. Hushang, who sells toys, has very dexterous hands. With them, he fashions the most fascinating little toys, and they are very popular amongst children.\nAnd, of course, everyone has long regarded this smart red-haired girl as a family member too.\nEvery time Nilou goes grocery shopping, she always ends up carrying more items than on her purchase list just by making a single trip through the streets, and the weight of the groceries shows exactly how much people like and take care of Nilou.\nOf course, Nilou also takes care of them in return.\nHushang and Farhad may have a quarrel over a bet, about as long as Nilou shows up, the two will surely be reconciled.\nIf Afshin's Sumpter Beasts have stolen someone else's food, Nilou will come forward and help make amends.\nIf you ask Nilou why she is so enthusiastic, she will answer with a smile:\n\"Because family is supposed to help each other, hehe.\"\nFor Nilou, her mom and dad are her small family, while everyone in the Grand Bazaar is her big family."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 6</color>\nBe it in day-to-day life or her performances on stage, Nilou has always maintained a simple attitude—\nTo melt everyone's worries away and let comfort and ease waltz in.\nBut when \"trouble\" comes to her, she is often distressed due to her inability to make the call.\nTahchin sure is delicious, but Pita Pocket is also good, and I also saw someone holding a Potato Boat that seemed really yummy. Which one should I eat tonight?\nI've heard people talk about places outside Sumeru City... the pure white snowy mountain and windmills the size of giants... Should I also consider going out for a trip?\nNilou can often find good reasons to go with any of the options she is considering, and so they are like Forest Tree Frogs sitting across from one another with bellies out, not one able to win the others over.\nBut if there was a person who could make a decision at this time and tell her with confidence and calm:\n\"Why not have half the amount of each and share them with me?\"\n\"And as for those places you have never been to, I have already set foot there. I can assure you that they are safe.\"\n...Nilou would dismiss her hesitation in an instant and raise her arms in a dance-like graceful gesture of thanks, before indulging in the joy of having solved a great problem for a long time indeed."

That said, such givers will definitely receive a gift in return the very next day, along with a note that has been left at their doors...\n\"Thank you for your kindness. If you would like to express your love for Nilou's dance, you may write a letter to the Zubayr Theater instead of sending gifts.\"\nAnd so it came to pass that like snow flakes dancing and falling in the air, letters filled with the audience members' passionate praise have been sent in batches and droves by the Dusk Birds to the theater's mailbox.\nDuring her free time when there are no shows or rehearsals, Nilou will read every letter carefully, share this joy with the other members of the Zubayr Theater, and then carefully preserve these letters.\nEvery word and every expression of recognition and fondness in the letters is worth remembering and appreciating.\nAs Nilou bettered her dancing skills, more and more people came to watch her dance, and in time, the letters have added up to quite the stack indeed.\nBut if someone cracks a joke, saying that Nilou is the most valuable treasure in the Zubayr Theater, she will definitely shake her head with a sweet smile.\n\"Our most valuable treasure is our audience's love, and it is all carefully stored in one mysterious box.\""

From her teacher's perspective, dance is born from human life and has belonged to everyone from the very beginning.\n\"As a dancer, you should convey emotions on stage, and your audience's smiles are their response to the emotions conveyed in your dance.\"\nNilou was well aware that she was nowhere near as good at thinking about the \"meaning\" behind things as Akademiya researchers. But still, she practiced diligently each day under the direction of her teacher and planned to continue following in her footsteps.\nWhen she finally first took the stage, she quickly became completely immersed in the performance, holding nothing back.\nShe thought of the wind, the moon, the gentle sound of the rose blooming, the feeling of stroking the tail feathers of Dusk Birds, and a myriad of beautiful things that existed in this world.\nShe wanted to display the beauty she perceived in her heart to the entire audience through her dance.\nSlowly, splashes of water ran together, converging into a lake on the stage. Like a Crystalfly dancing on a lake's surface, Nilou gently fluttered back and forth, and the lake-mirror rippled slightly in time to her steps.\nLike a water lily, her body swirled in the middle of that lake. Amazed at such pure and flawless beauty, the audience almost forgot to breathe.\nAfter the curtain fell, Nilou flopped down on the backstage chair and took deep breaths.\nLike dewdrops on a lotus leaf, a Hydro Vision had appeared at her waist.\nNilou thought then that she had perhaps found the purpose of dance at last —\n\"To become beauty, and then to convey the beauty and value of art.\""

But... I also have to pay more attention to my figure.\nBut you shouldn't have that problem!
