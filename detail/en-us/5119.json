These plains were transformed into a huge and deep chasm in the wake of that star's descent. Beautiful and limitless jade emerged from within, and it became the foundation for a thousand years of industrial mining in Liyue thereafter. As most know, wordless stones harbored soul and spirit, and in manners and times not witnessed by mortal eyes, they watched and listened to the ley lines' pulses, the echoes of the alpine springs, and the slow but inexorable movements of the mountains. But unlike the ordinary but enduring stone of the earth, the fragments of the meteorite that fell from heaven had a proud and agitated temper. Later, when countless gods and rulers\nover the appointed celestial seats, and the very stars and abyss themselves faded, tragedy and evil embarred the breath of the waters and mountains. The fallen star could bear this no longer, and heedless of the great chasm's persuasions to stay, it leaped away, away towards the heavens. As it returned to the skies, the heavenly jade left behind a deep pit, within which humans would build great cities and mighty fortresses, finding refuge and shutting themselves in with the leftover inheritance of that fallen star. Another legend has it that it was not a meteorite but a solar chariot that raced across the earth. When three Moon Goddesses were martyred in a calamity, the solar chariot fell into a deep gorge. Fortunately, the device was repaired, and the sun shone through the darkness again. Although it was returned to its constant westward cycle, a single piece would forever remain behind. When they moved to the city, they would grind that fragment into crystals and sell it to someone who knew its value."

The people of the valley communicated with the heavens through jade. Celestia's\nwhose beauty was pure as moonlight, would lead and protect people. There's a legend that the jade scattered among the rocks came from the azure heavens. Celestia's envoys bestowed these beauteous gems upon the early residents and guided them to build a ritual jade altar that reached the heavens, so that they may receive the blessings and curses from above. But the ancient sin buried beneath their feet and hidden beneath the deepest mines was unknown to mortals. After the war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came, a Spiritstone fell from the heavens onto the mines — a huge, sky-blue crystal pillar that sealed away the filth. After the war, the angels fell silent and stopped guiding the people, and due to changes in the geology, the people of Yu Valley moved far north, founding Chenyu Vale."

Accustomed to city life, they gradually forgot about their past and became Shenglu Hall, one of Liyue's Eight Trades. Abandoning their old warlike roots, they made a living by making and selling porcelain, and participated in the great battles to subdue Azhdaha and repel the black calamity, making great contributions to Liyue.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Liyue suffered the same fate, and under the command of Rex Lapis, the Millelith fought to the last breath. As the Abyss gushed into this world from the depths of The Chasm, where the Archon entrusted the Millelith with the evacuation of the locals and the protection of the mines, some soldiers remained to cover the retreat and hold the front line near The Chasm. The Millelith's commander died in the line of duty, as did part of his troop. To ensure that the afflicted civilians could safely escape and to maintain their honor in the eyes of the Lord of Geo, helmet-clad troops of the front line took the lead, pointing their spears towards the Abyss and charging into battle. But these beasts were incredibly ferocious, and the situation on the battlefield was dire. At the decisive moment, the four-armed Yaksha,\narrived to help the Millelith. The Yakshas had long served the Lord of Geo and fought demons, but due to the remains of dead gods and deaths, their bodies and minds were corroded by karma. When Bosacius went to The Chasm, he had already lost his mind and forgotten his name, but the aura of that battle attracted him. According to rumors, the Yaksha defended The Chasm to atone for eternal sins, to gain forgiveness for the cowardice and weakness he once showed. Be that as it may, when there was no hope, Bosacius distracted the monsters and turned the tide of the battle."

According to observations, the monsters approaching it became weaker, so the soldiers assumed that some force rested underground, capable of suppressing the monsters of the Abyss. Together with other soldiers, the four-armed Yaksha descended lower and lower into the depths of The Chasm. Ordinary mortals who fought side by side with Bosacius could not escape the harmful influence of karma or the suffering from murder. To avoid being consumed by the darkness of constant killing, the Millelith soldiers used a timepiece to silently mark the passage of time during each battle. They fixed a unified marching pace and schedule so that one squadron of mortal soldiers would take the battlefield as the one before them retreated. This cycle of advance and retreat continued all the way to the depths of The Chasm."

Boyang wanted to take some of the Millelith to the underground palace to lure the monsters as deep as possible. Using the Fantastic Compass, he and Bosacius recreated the seal from the inside, and Boyang's brother helped them from the outside to make the seal whole. Thanks to their sacrifice, The Chasm was safe, but Boyang, the Yaksha, and the Millelith that followed them were trapped. The monsters were unable to move, and most were destroyed, but despite their victory, the Millelith could not escape. Over time, the soldiers died, and Bosacius and Boyang were left alone. Before his death, the four-armed Yaksha's mind cleared, and he remembered his comrades. When Boyang was all alone, he had a vision of his house, wife, and children. They approached him, then passed through, and disappeared. His thoughts were becoming increasingly confused, and sometimes he felt hatred that all this suffering had fallen on him and not on his brother, but he was still glad that his younger brother had survived. Boyang did not escape from The Chasm, no one on the surface knew the name of the four-armed Yaksha, and Boyang's brother, who returned home, was never the same again and eventually lost his mind. Their names were forgotten, but thanks to their sacrifice, the soldiers defeated the monsters of the Abyss and saved Liyue."

While she was preparing to never see the light again, the precious gems on the bow emitted a glow. According to the legends of the people of the mountains, the dark bats she felled with every shot, and the giant tortoise of the dark ooze, she nailed to the ground. The magnificent bow danced like the clouds themselves, its arrows' cold gleam tearing through blighted beast-flesh. No deluge of filth from the abyss, nor twisted demon from the warped depths, no incomprehensible terror could make her heart quail, or force her to retreat.

They can be used to direct the Ley Lines' energy. If the Ley Lines become corrupted, the fetor seeps into the world, infecting people, and the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method is used, and this was famously used by the Eight Adepts during the sanctification of Tao Dou. The seven gates are the requirement for activating the array. The array master will select one gate from the eight to subdue evil, cutting off its exit path by using the Ley Lines' power to obfuscate themselves. The gate would disappear from the Ley Lines completely, never to be seen again — taking the banished evil along with them. As the state of the Ley Lines is intricately linked to human activity, the gates' locations are subject to change over time. The Gate of Injury symbolizes wounds and loss, and is one of the three gates of great misfortune, along with the Gates of Death and Fright. That is why it appeared in The Chasm, where the Abyss spilled out thousands of years ago, and where the Milleliths and the Yaksha Bosacius sacrificed themselves during the Cataclysm 500 years ago.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Near one of the hilichurls, the Traveler discovered an Inteyvat flower, the Khaenri'ahn national flower, which once bloomed in all corners of the nation. Its bloom lasted only two weeks, and if the flower was picked and taken away from Khaenri'ah, the petals stopped growing and hardened. Only after the flower returned to its native soil did the petals become soft again and eventually turn to dust. To the people of Khaenri'ah, the Inteyvat was a symbol for a wanderer far from home, signifying the tenderness of the homeland. In addition, this flower was worn in Lumine's hair. Upon touching the flower, the Traveler saw their twin discussing with an Abyss Herald the ritual to revive Khaenri'ah using the device underneath the fountain. Dainsleif was certain that the revival of his homeland and the lifting of the curse were impossible, and attempting to forcibly dispel it would only lead to more suffering, so they hurried to stop the Abyss Order from trampling the will of Halfdan and the other Black Serpent Knights."

After replacing the frets we'd previously broken, the balalaika sounds much more natural now.\nBut just for the record, since you asked me to keep it, I'm not gonna give it back to you! If my clumsy sister should damage this old pal of mine once more, I won't go through the trouble of repairing it again!\nOh right, I recently learned two new songs. Wait to be impressed when you report in — let me play the songs to you by the bonfire, just like in the old days when we would sing to the melody of balalaika, giggle at the jokes we share, and look forward to the precious gifts from the Tsaritsa to our brothers and sisters in the House of the Hearth in celebration of a new year...\nWhat's different, however, is that we're no longer carefree children. With greater responsibilities on our shoulders come heavier loads on our minds.\nThe Captain granted a half-day pass especially for us. Don't forget to bring your liquor and desserts. Let's booze it up and talk it out! I've so many stories to share with you. I believe you too have had quite an adventure where you were previously deployed!\nBy the way, don't laugh at me if you notice that I've put on some weight!
