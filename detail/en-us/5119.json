After replacing the frets we'd previously broken, the balalaika sounds much more natural now.\nBut just for the record, since you asked me to keep it, I'm not gonna give it back to you! If my clumsy sister should damage this old pal of mine once more, I won't go through the trouble of repairing it again!\nOh right, I recently learned two new songs. Wait to be impressed when you report in — let me play the songs to you by the bonfire, just like in the old days when we would sing to the melody of balalaika, giggle at the jokes we share, and look forward to the precious gifts from the Tsaritsa to our brothers and sisters in the House of the Hearth in celebration of a new year...\nWhat's different, however, is that we're no longer carefree children. With greater responsibilities on our shoulders come heavier loads on our minds.\nThe Captain granted a half-day pass especially for us. Don't forget to bring your liquor and desserts. Let's booze it up and talk it out! I've so many stories to share with you. I believe you too have had quite an adventure where you were previously deployed!\nBy the way, don't laugh at me if you notice that I've put on some weight!
