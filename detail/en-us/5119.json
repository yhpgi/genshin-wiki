When he was young, he spent most of his time at the Yanshang Teahouse, where he was deeply in debt. He had no time to go and did not want to go home, but eventually, the debt collectors found his father in Shenglu Hall, and he paid off the debts. When his father found him, he was living on the streets like a beaten-up dog. Then his father said to him, <color=#ffffffd9>\"I have all your IOUs, so now you're indebted to me.\"</color> Back when Muning spent his days hiding from debt collectors in fear and unable to sleep, he vowed that he would mend his ways if life gave him a second chance.

The beauty of this magnificent gemstone is beyond imagination, and it is said that if you look inside the Archaic Stone, you will see the finest shimmering rays of light, like the horizon of the sea at dusk. When someone saw the stone in Muning's possession, they offered him a good price for it, and he sold the Archaic Stone to get some Mora. But later, his father asked him about the stone, and he reluctantly answered that he had lost it. After that conversation, Muning could not stop thinking about what would have happened if he had taken out the Archaic Stone in response to the question. During Muning's work at the Ministry, the Huishan Mining Hall became interested in the Archaic Stones and wanted to analyze them, so they sent Muning into The Chasm to get samples, but he was unable to find any. It was only with the help of the Traveler that he was able to obtain nine samples of the Archaic Stones."

At first, they simply stole ore and Glaze Sand Crystals for smuggling, but then they became so bold that they occupied the old warehouses left by the miners and began making cheap jewelry for sale. Although such low-quality jewelry could only fool gullible tourists who had never been to Liyue or people who only learned from books, the Millelith decided to clear The Chasm of Treasure Hoarders. In order to carry out the operation, a squad of Millelith began posing as Treasure Hoarders. They also learned that the leaders of the Treasure Hoarders were in contact with the Fatui and were possibly preparing a deal related to the trade of dangerous materials. The Millelith informant reported that the Fatui were buying something from the Treasure Hoarders and paying with large amounts of Mora and military supplies, but he only found food and household items, so it was probably a trick to distract them. Just when the undercover squad had everything they needed for a major offensive and were just about to expose them, the soldiers were discovered by the Traveler and Paimon, who mistook them for ordinary Treasure Hoarders. Joining forces, the Traveler and the Millelith went to Lumberpick Valley to capture a food camp in the southeast, a weapons camp in the east, and an alchemy camp in the northeast. By taking these camps by surprise, they completely cut off their supplies and were able to attack the camp where the main transaction between the Fatui and the Treasure Hoarders was to take place. But even after defeating them, the Millelith only found deals in the works to buy food."

But then he showed up as if nothing had happened, and even with the results of an experiment in which he had been helped by the Traveler and Paimon. Since his presence and purpose in The Chasm for the experiment were illegal, and the data obtained was excessively detailed and complete, the Institute decided that the data was pulled out of thin air and sent Anatole to reproduce the experiment. With the help of the Traveler, the results were confirmed, but the head of the Institute declared that there was no economic benefit to the study, and Patrice was unable to obtain further funding. Anatole and Patrice returned to The Chasm to experiment with practical applications for the technology. Anatole came up with the idea of connecting the Receiver Crystal to the rope-pull mechanism that controls the lighting, and then all that would be left to do was remotely activate the Transmitter Crystal to turn off the ceiling light. It would also be possible to attach the Receiver Crystal to things that people lose, so that they could be easily found using the Transmitter Crystal.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

After that, the dragon accompanied Rex Lapis on his travels and fought shoulder to shoulder with him in numerous battles. Over time, due to erosion, Azhdaha's memory faded into obscurity. He forgot the face of his old friend, and the memory of Liyue's protection crumbled like sand. Once whole, Azhdaha became irascible and aggressive. Erosion made him even more savage, and no matter how he struggled, he lost the ability to coexist with humanity and lost all reason. To stop the erosion, the Lord of Geo shared some of his power with Azhdaha, but it was all in vain. One day, the dragon attacked miners in The Chasm who were shaking the Ley Lines with ore mining, causing Azhdaha to suffer. The Geo Archon was forced to fight his friend and hid him from people by sealing him underground. Traces of the battle between Rex Lapis and the Dragon Lord are still visible in the Fuao Vale. Short-term earthquakes sometimes occur in The Chasm, which old miners called \"Azhdaha's Breath.\" After the battle between the Geo Archon and Azhdaha, the Dragonfall, an incredibly rare ore used in forging, was born. The majority of regular crystals are formed in high-temperature environments. Dragonfall, on the other hand, is formed as a product of elemental reactions.

Elemental reactions within The Chasm over a long history have colored the soil a wonderful purple-red. On the cliff, Tang Wuchou, who introduces himself as a true disciple of the 320th Guhua Clan generation, can be met. On one of the peaks, he found several Qingxin flowers growing and took them under his care, intending to build a lovely and great Glaze Lily garden, far from the structures and standards of the norm. When the Traveler and Paimon plucked one of the flowers, the Flower of Farsight, which needed to be offered to the ancient treasury, Tang Wuchou attacked them but was easily defeated. When the Traveler and Paimon did not believe him about belonging to the Guhua Clan because of his Treasure Hoarders' clothes, he showed them a jade pendant as proof. This pendant was sold to him by an old friend when they parted, and as soon as Tang Wuchou began to wear it, an Adeptus appeared to him on the first night and taught him the secret arts of the Guhua Clan. And every time he practiced martial arts, Tang Wuchou felt a slight tingling in his head, which he took as evidence of the development and expansion of consciousness. The Traveler and Paimon realized that because of the strange pendant filled with Geo energy, the man believed that he was a disciple of the Guhua Clan, and this began to drive him crazy. If he continued to wear the pendant and go into a fantasy world, trouble would definitely happen to him. In order to save Tang Wuchou, the Traveler and Paimon exchanged the pendant for a chicken egg, in which the man saw a huge gem."

Old Chou and Tang Wuchou were once Treasure Hoarders, but after a profitable deal in The Chasm, their paths diverged. One day, Chou was found by his former colleagues, who threatened to buy up their low-grade jewelry and sell it in Liyue. He was forced to slash his prices and operate at a loss until the Treasure Hoarders were finally arrested by the Millelith with the help of the Traveler. One of the items that Chou sold was a jade pendant. The merchant had hoped to get a fortune for it, but Tang Wuchou took notice and convinced him to sell it for cheap. The pendant's material was imbued with elemental energy, and if a person without a Vision came into contact with it, their personality would change. The description reminded Chou of the legend of \"Smaragdus Jadeite.\" It was rumored that this material was incredibly valuable, but caused certain inconveniences to its owners and concealed ominous omens. Smaragdus Jadeite is one of the treasures of the Adepti, in which their power is contained, and not every person can withstand prolonged contact with this mineral without harm to their health. The \"Seven Mountain Treatises\" states that this substance springs forth from Stonemarrow within the mountains and will bring disaster to any mere mortals who touch it. Best case scenario, they fall ill, worst-case scenario, they'll suffer great changes in personality, and their illness will only ever get worse. The Traveler and Paimon had already encountered Smaragdus Jadeite once, when they created an abode inside a teapot with the help of the Adeptal powers."

After the Traveler and Paimon rescued a missing miner from The Chasm who had been eating mushrooms for over a year, he went to Cinnabar Cliff and, mistaking Tang Wuchou's Qingxin flowers for mushrooms, began eating them. Thanks to the intervention of the Traveler and Paimon, the conflict was resolved.

As her father gradually grew older and his eyes weakened, it fell to her alone to be responsible for the safety of the equipment in the mines. Although she had a daughter of her own, the latter went to study in Sumeru, while Jinwu took care of the children of the miners who had died. She worked in the mines for about twenty years and became a real big sister to the miners, including Zhiqiong. In order to facilitate the exploration of The Chasm, Jinwu gave the Traveler the Lumenstone Adjuvant, which dispels darkness and miasma, destroys mud holes in mines, and lights lamps. The Adjuvant is capable of absorbing the energy from Lucklight Flies, Noctilucous Jade, Lumenstones, and lightstone lamps, and can only be properly used by Vision bearers. The composition of the Lumenstone Adjuvant is similar to the Glaze Sand Crystals and Lumenstone Ore that began to appear in the dark tunnels after the fall of the divine nail. This ore has the magical ability to accumulate energy and emit light, and if listened to closely, sounds similar to sighs can be heard from it. One of the names for this ore is the wishstone, and superstitious miners say that it can miraculously grant a person's wish that they did not even ask for. Lumenspars are similar to Luminous Ore and are a manifestation of the \"thing\" underground. Due to their structural similarities, crystals, ore, and Adjuvant can resonate with each other, so Jinwu can upgrade the Adjuvant by collecting a certain amount of crystals and ore, allowing it to accumulate more energy and destroy large oozing concretions."

In Ad-Hoc Main Tunnel, old diaries were found in which the miner wrote about the strange Black Magma oozing from underground and unusual mushrooms. When approaching the Black Magma, his thoughts grew jumbled, and his senses became agitated. However, near the Lumenspars, these deleterious effects retreated greatly. This Magma attracted elemental creatures, who began to feed on it, but the man felt that something was wrong and decided to find a place where mushrooms grow. Gradually, the miner began to hear as if someone was calling him and saying that there was water and mushrooms in the depths."

His skin color had turned dark red, and he kept talking about mushrooms and seemed not to understand questions. After feeding him mushrooms, they were able to take the miner to the exploration team's camp, where he was examined by Khedive. The spores of the mushroom got into the miner's ear canal, which is why his ears were constantly itchy, and with prolonged use, the mushrooms worsened his sanity. When these mushrooms were first found in The Chasm, a scholar wanted to study the effects of long-term use, but no one wanted to participate in the experiment and eat them. Upon study, it turned out that due to the special environment of the mines, the mushrooms began to have hallucinogenic effects, but did not cause irreversible harm to the human body and mind. Khedive cleaned the fungus from Uncle He's body and gave him medicine to restore his nerves, so he should have recovered after a long rest."

When they arrived at The Chasm, there were sixty-four people in the company, but only Anton, Danila, Temur, and Radomir remained. According to the agreement with the authorities of Liyue, the Fatui's task was to study the cause of the incident in The Chasm and protect people from the black disaster. When the mines were first sealed, trade agreements were concluded between Snezhnaya and Liyue on both sides, and the transfer of the Fatui to The Chasm was one of the additional conditions. The Ninth Company arrived to conduct research and destroy the source of the anomaly, and all information obtained during the investigations was shared between Snezhnaya and Liyue. At first, the residents of Liyue even blessed the squad, since to them, they were heroes sacrificing themselves for others. The Fatui discovered a crystal older than The Chasm itself and found that the black substance was growing in quantity every day. The Ninth Company wanted to use the Mokosh Device, which could theoretically handle the corruption of the Abyss, but an explosion of unknown origin caused the device to overload and fail. As a result of the battles with monsters and the forces of corruption, almost all of the Ninth Company were killed or missing, and supplies were no longer coming down from above. At first, the Fatui made an agreement with the Treasure Hoarders to exchange money and military supplies for food and essential goods, but the contact, Clitopho, disappeared, and the Millelith arrested all the Treasure Hoarders. When the Traveler and Paimon climbed up to the supply point, it turned out that it had long been abandoned, and cooperation with the Fatui had ceased after the incident with the Harbingers and the Overlord of the Vortex, Osial. The cooperation agreement with Snezhnaya was cancelled, the Millelith were forbidden to interact with the Fatui under penalty of arrest, and all Fatui were declared enemy criminals. The leader of the Millelith squad, with whom the Fatui and the Traveler worked together, left Anton a letter informing him of the change in the situation and the hidden provisions. Realizing that they were no longer welcome in Liyue and that the Harbinger Pulcinella had given up relatively low-value assets for more significant endeavors, the Ninth Company decided to retreat. In parting, they asked to find their comrade, Katarina, who had gone in search of her brother, Nikolay.\nIn this location, the World Quests"

When the miners dug up the shard, Lumenstones began to appear all over The Chasm. After the shard appeared, the changes in the geological structure of the mines began to accelerate: black matter began to appear, covering the stones, dark mud, and oozing concretions began to spread throughout the mines. Dark mud is a mysterious, poisonous substance that erupts from a fissure in the ground, causing a deadly, destructive effect on any organism nearby. The oozing concretion is the core of the dark mud, and only by destroying it can the mud be eliminated. Monsters that find themselves inside the spill of filth become even more ferocious and feed on this energy. The miners who dug up the crystal thought it was a \"Wish Granter,\" and that any wish would come true if they approached it. But the fragment drove the miners mad, and the Qixing was forced to seal the mine. When Zhiqiong came into contact with the fragment, she felt a sense of nausea, like the motion sickness of a carriage or the disorientation of a ship during a storm. She had felt the same way near the dark mud, but she continued to explore the mines despite her deteriorating health. When the Traveler cleared the fragment, it flew away and cleared the way further, and Zhiqiong felt relieved, as if the air had become cleaner again.\nIn the Stony Halls, the Traveler and Paimon found the miner, Qi Ding, who was looking for a doll for his daughter. This doll was very rare, so he asked his acquaintances to buy one from the Feiyun Commerce Guild and treasured it like the apple of his eye, but one day he lost it. The Traveler and Paimon offered to help the miner find it and took him to the surface to see Muning. While searching for the doll, they found a torn sheet of paper from a notebook:"

After they returned to the miner, it turned out that Qi Ding had become obsessed with his long stay in the depths of The Chasm, but when he came to the surface, his mind became clear. When the Qixing sealed The Chasm, Qi Ding could not allow the mines to be closed, otherwise, he would lose his job, so he decided to blow up the \"Wish Granter.\" But as soon as he went down and approached the stone, his head suddenly began to hurt, and everything swam before his eyes. It was only when he left the mines that he was able to come to his senses. The doll that Qi Ding asked to find actually belonged to his daughter, but after playing with it for a while, the man began to carry the doll around with him as a talisman. The daughter had long since grown up and worked in the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the girl that the Traveler and Paimon met was only a reflection of the powers of the \"Wish Granter.\""

Once, with the help of his \"children,\" he controlled the minds of people so that they would worship him. During the Archon War, Bifrons was banished by Al-Ahmar and was forced to find a new home, going to the volcano in Natlan, while Xamaran, who considers Bifrons \"his foolish father,\" separated and went to the underground mines of Liyue. They have had no business with one another for many long years, and Xamaran almost forgot its progenitor's name. Over time, the corrupted energy of the Abyss in the mines became stronger and stronger, and in the fight against it, Xamaran's strength was exhausted. Thanks to the energy of the Lumenstone Adjuvant, some of Xamaran's strength was restored, and he shared the Blessing of Wisdom with the Traveler so that they could cleanse the black mud and destroy the source of the corrupted power. When the land was cleared, the mushroom went into hibernation to gain strength to fight the corrupted energy, shelter its relatives, and reproduce. Around Xamaran, unusual glowing mushrooms, identical to one of the mushroom species growing in Sumeru, can be found. After studying these mushrooms, Khedive came to the conclusion that their luminescence may be the result of absorbing the energy of the shards of the divine nail."

One of the creatures living in the Dendro Dragon believed that the apocalypse was a part of them, and therefore, it was important to preserve it. The other creatures did not agree with it, and it left Sumeru and went to the bottomless depths to the east of Sumeru, to a black place from which there is no return, The Chasm. The Greater Lord, together with this creature, created the Fire Seed, which mimicked how the Dendro Dragon's \"Heart of Oasis\" operated. The Heart of Oasis was Apep's source of power. With the Seed, the Heart of the Oasis could be reactivated, so the Dendro Dragon would begin to recover.

These plains were transformed into a huge and deep chasm in the wake of that star's descent. Beautiful and limitless jade emerged from within, and it became the foundation for a thousand years of industrial mining in Liyue thereafter. As most know, wordless stones harbored soul and spirit, and in manners and times not witnessed by mortal eyes, they watched and listened to the ley lines' pulses, the echoes of the alpine springs, and the slow but inexorable movements of the mountains. But unlike the ordinary but enduring stone of the earth, the fragments of the meteorite that fell from heaven had a proud and agitated temper. Later, when countless gods and rulers\nover the appointed celestial seats, and the very stars and abyss themselves faded, tragedy and evil embarred the breath of the waters and mountains. The fallen star could bear this no longer, and heedless of the great chasm's persuasions to stay, it leaped away, away towards the heavens. As it returned to the skies, the heavenly jade left behind a deep pit, within which humans would build great cities and mighty fortresses, finding refuge and shutting themselves in with the leftover inheritance of that fallen star. Another legend has it that it was not a meteorite but a solar chariot that raced across the earth. When three Moon Goddesses were martyred in a calamity, the solar chariot fell into a deep gorge. Fortunately, the device was repaired, and the sun shone through the darkness again. Although it was returned to its constant westward cycle, a single piece would forever remain behind. When they moved to the city, they would grind that fragment into crystals and sell it to someone who knew its value."

The people of the valley communicated with the heavens through jade. Celestia's\nwhose beauty was pure as moonlight, would lead and protect people. There's a legend that the jade scattered among the rocks came from the azure heavens. Celestia's envoys bestowed these beauteous gems upon the early residents and guided them to build a ritual jade altar that reached the heavens, so that they may receive the blessings and curses from above. But the ancient sin buried beneath their feet and hidden beneath the deepest mines was unknown to mortals. After the war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came, a Spiritstone fell from the heavens onto the mines — a huge, sky-blue crystal pillar that sealed away the filth. After the war, the angels fell silent and stopped guiding the people, and due to changes in the geology, the people of Yu Valley moved far north, founding Chenyu Vale."

Liyue suffered the same fate, and under the command of Rex Lapis, the Millelith fought to the last breath. As the Abyss gushed into this world from the depths of The Chasm, the Geo Archon entrusted the Millelith with the evacuation of the locals and the protection of the mines. Some soldiers remained to cover the retreat and hold the front line near The Chasm. The Millelith's commander died in the line of duty, as did part of his troop. To ensure that the afflicted civilians could safely escape and to maintain their honor in the eyes of the Lord of Geo, helmet-clad troops of the front line took the lead, pointing their spears towards the Abyss and charging into battle. But these beasts were incredibly ferocious, and the situation on the battlefield was dire. At the decisive moment, the four-armed Yaksha,\narrived to help the Millelith. The Yakshas had long served the Lord of Geo and fought demons, but due to the remains of curses, dead gods, and beasts, their bodies and minds were corroded by karma. When Bosacius went to The Chasm, he had already lost his mind and forgotten his name, but the aura of that battle attracted him. According to rumors, the Yaksha defended The Chasm to atone for eternal sins, to gain forgiveness for the cowardice and weakness he once showed. Be that as it may, when there was no hope, Bosacius distracted the monsters and turned the tide of the battle."

Ordinary mortals who fought side by side with Bosacius could not escape the harmful influence of karma or the suffering from murder. To avoid being consumed by the darkness of constant killing, the Millelith soldiers used a timepiece to silently mark the passage of time during each battle. They fixed a unified marching pace and schedule so that one squadron of mortal soldiers would take the battlefield as the one before them retreated. This cycle of advance and retreat continued all the way to the depths of The Chasm."

Using the Fantastic Compass, he and Bosacius recreated the seal from the inside, and Boyang's brother helped them from the outside to make the seal whole. Thanks to their sacrifice, The Chasm was safe, but Boyang, the Yaksha, and the Millelith that followed them were trapped. The monsters were unable to move, and most were destroyed, but despite their victory, the Millelith could not escape. Over time, the soldiers died, and Bosacius and Boyang were left alone. Before his death, the four-armed Yaksha's mind cleared, and he remembered his comrades. When Boyang was all alone, he had a vision of his house, wife, and children. They approached him, then passed through, and disappeared. His thoughts were becoming increasingly confused, and sometimes he felt hatred that all this suffering had fallen on him and not on his brother, but he was still glad that his younger brother had survived. Boyang did not escape from The Chasm, no one on the surface knew the name of the four-armed Yaksha, and Boyang's brother, who returned home, was never the same again and eventually lost his mind. Their names were forgotten, but thanks to their sacrifice, the soldiers defeated the monsters of the Abyss and saved Liyue."

The Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, famously used by the Eight Adepts during the sanctification of Tao Dou, is a secret art used in such a case, which can suppress evil spirits and even gods. The seven gates are the requirement for activating the array. The array master will select one gate from the eight to subdue evil, cutting off its exit path by using the Ley Lines' power to obfuscate themselves. The gate would disappear from the Ley Lines completely, never to be seen again — taking the banished evil along with them. As the state of the Ley Lines is intricately linked to human activity, the gates' locations are subject to change over time. The Gate of Injury symbolizes wounds and loss, and is one of the three gates of great misfortune, along with the Gates of Death and Fright. That is why it appeared in The Chasm, where the Abyss spilled out thousands of years ago, and where the Millelith and the Yaksha Bosacius sacrificed themselves during the Cataclysm 500 years ago.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The familiar knight appeared again and ordered the others to retreat, and Dainsleif recognized him as Halfdan, once a young warrior from the royal guard. On the day of Khaenri'ah's fall, the Twilight Sword ordered Halfdan to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs, and even after the Cataclysm and the corruption of the curse, the guards continued to carry out this order as they saw the people of the kingdom in the hilichurls. In the upper levels of the city, Dainsleif and the Traveler discovered an inverted fountain, the water of which had a \"cleansing\" effect and weakened the curse. But even the fountain could not completely remove the curse: it was woven into the fate of the world itself, and existed on a higher level of reality than the people themselves."

Its bloom lasted only two weeks, and if the flower was picked and taken away from Khaenri'ah, the petals stopped growing and hardened. Only after the flower returned to its native soil did the petals become soft again and eventually turn to dust. To the people of Khaenri'ah, the Inteyvat was a symbol for a wanderer far from home, signifying the tenderness of the homeland. In addition, this flower was worn in Lumine's hair. Upon touching the flower, the Traveler saw their twin discussing with an Abyss Herald the ritual to revive Khaenri'ah using the device underneath the fountain. Dainsleif was certain that the revival of his homeland and the lifting of the curse were impossible, and attempting to forcibly dispel it would only lead to more suffering, so they hurried to stop the Abyss Order from trampling the will of Halfdan and the other Black Serpent Knights."

This place was beyond rational thought, and the time and space in the dungeon were chaotic, which led to the idea that Xiao had not gone down the same path as them. And his status was transmitted to them through some kind of mind-bending spatial alteration, because the place wanted it. When the team saw Xiao in the dungeon before, the place wanted to lure them into a trap, but the intersection of spaces created a spatial rift. After returning from the dungeon, Yanfei looked around and realized that the chaotic spaces were constantly intersecting, so anything could happen. And if the space-created phenomena were based on imagination, they needed to continue imagining. Yanfei listened closely and heard Xiao's voice behind the illusory wall and was able to convince the Adeptus to join them. After the wounded Xiao rested in the camp, he revealed that he was looking for the Yaksha Bosacius, whose body was never found. The last time they saw each other, Bosacius had already lost his mind. The eldest Yaksha always said that Yakshas were always fighting, and no matter whether they were dead or alive, they should take care of each other and know the fate of each of them until the very end. The Conqueror of Demons's only clue was the story of the battle during the Cataclysm, so he went into The Chasm."

Tired of the arguments in the team, Itto decided to punch a hole in the wall and open a new passage, but he used up all his strength and lost consciousness. Leaving Itto with Shinobu and Ushi, the others went into the dungeon, where they saw a huge round plate in the sky, the Fantastic Compass. A smaller version of the compass was stuck in the ground of the dungeon, and turning the arrow on it opened up new passages that led to the same place, but in a different time. At one of these points in time, Xiao encountered the phantom of Bosacius. After saying goodbye to the fallen Yaksha, the team discovered the records of Boyang, Yelan's missing ancestor, who, like Bosacius, was trapped in the subspace of The Chasm. Reaching the end of the dungeon, the team found themselves in a place created from the memories of the Traveler, in which the power of the Abyss deprived them of their family. They saw the Fantastic Compass lying on the ground, and Yelan recognized it as an artifact that her family had owned since ancient times."

Together, they were able to open a rift in space, but trapped souls began to attack them, and Xiao spent almost all his strength to drive them away and maintain the compass's energy. Realizing that he could no longer use the power of the Fantastic Compass, the Conqueror of Demons moved everyone to the surface, spending the last of his strength and sacrificing himself.

After replacing the frets we'd previously broken, the balalaika sounds much more natural now.\nBut just for the record, since you asked me to keep it, I'm not gonna give it back to you! If my clumsy sister should damage this old pal of mine once more, I won't go through the trouble of repairing it again!\nOh right, I recently learned two new songs. Wait to be impressed when you report in — let me play the songs to you by the bonfire, just like in the old days when we would sing to the melody of balalaika, giggle at the jokes we share, and look forward to the precious gifts from the Tsaritsa to our brothers and sisters in the House of the Hearth in celebration of a new year...\nWhat's different, however, is that we're no longer carefree children. With greater responsibilities on our shoulders come heavier loads on our minds.\nThe Captain granted a half-day pass especially for us. Don't forget to bring your liquor and desserts. Let's booze it up and talk it out! I've so many stories to share with you. I believe you too have had quite an adventure where you were previously deployed!\nBy the way, don't laugh at me if you notice that I've put on some weight!
