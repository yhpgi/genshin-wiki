What a clever calico!\"\nThe calico bowed gracefully once more, and returned to her place with the elegance of a noblewoman.\n\"I—It's time for this loyal servant to speak now, isn't it...\" The firewood cat spoke flatteringly.\n\"The fur of your humble servant was burned away when I was seeking warmth in a pile of firewood...\n\"It was really so strange. Your humble servant had just fallen asleep, and it was warm, so warm... one dreamt of being a kitten once more, and sleeping in mother's fur... As I slept, my fur caught fire...\n\"Th—Thanks to the Boss's support, your humble servant often roams through the city sewers, delivering messages, passing info, running errands, that sort of thing, for I'm not afraid of getting dirty...\n\"O—Other than that, I'm really isn't good for anything else...\"\nThe tabby cat cleared his throat, and the firewood cat flinched, smiling and quietly retreating.\n\"Very well. You should now be well aware of the work we regularly do here at the Feline Firm.\n\"We have invited you here because we've encountered an unsolvable problem, and would like to request your help, Monsieur Perroux!\""
