Instead, it's more that...\nThis \"Peacemaker\" is just ludicrously strong, and she fights in a manner that makes a mockery of common sense. To engage her head-on is comparable to an unarmed newborn babe challenging the fiercest Qucusaurus.\nThose infatuated with conflict often also fear strength, and thus they commonly find sitting down to talk the best choice when confronted by power far beyond their own.\nStill, they wonder, how is Chasca always able to appear at the center of conflict at just the right moment?\nWith such uncanny accuracy, such fortuity, it is as if she is drawn in by conflict itself, or rather... like a \"beast\" who catches the scent of her \"prey.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 2</color>\nChasca has lived alongside Qucusaurs for as long as she can remember.\nInitially, she believed herself to be a Saurian, though she lacked the hooked beak and sharp talons her mother and elder sister possessed, and she could not fly, nor could she leap into the crowns of trees in a single bound.\nHer mother loved her just as she did her own flesh and blood, and when returning from a hunt, would always ensure her daughters ate their fill first, before contenting herself with the remainder.\nHowever, Chasca was not content to remain a fledgling waiting to be fed.\nOnce she was finally grown enough to race across slopes and bound over rivers, she would often leave the nest to watch her mother and sister hunt.\nShe would remember how they fought, and adapt those techniques for her own use. She had no wings she could spread to fly, so she would leap amongst the treetops. She was not born with beak and claw, so she would arm herself with stones in their place.\nAll too eager to attempt a hunt of her own, she wandered the woods until at last, her first mighty foe came forth — a foraging Forest Boar.\nImitating the Qucusaurs' movements, she leaped at the boar, only to be sent spinning to the ground by its fierce charge.\nRolling to her feet, she snatched up a nearby rock and hurled it, only for the boar to dodge.\nUltimately, she was forced to return empty-handed, her whole body ragged, covered head to toe in injuries and abrasions.\nHer mother brought herbs to treat her, and her sister vigorously opposed any future forays.\nChasca agreed to stay and heal in the nest, but dove into the mountains the instant her wounds closed.\nShe shuttled between forest and stream, collecting all manner of odds and ends to use: Sharp-edged stones, sturdy sticks, sticky sap, the skins of dead animals...\nHer family did not quite understand the purpose of all this \"junk,\" but thought Chasca having a new hobby was a good thing nonetheless.\nThey never imagined she would use them to fashion a new weapon — a slingshot made from sticks and skin, all the better for shooting stones both faster and further.\n...\nThe Forest Boar had a little squirrel cornered, yet what it had not realized was that it too had entered another's hunting grounds.\nWithout warning, it found something stuck to its hooves, and it struggled in vain to get free. Then, several sharp objects, whistling through the air, struck its skull one after another. With a cry, the boar fell into a dead faint on the spot.\nOnly then did Chasca emerge from the bush and excitedly drag her trophy back to the nest.\nHer mother and sister thought then that Chasca would surely become a skilled huntress — yet the way events were to unfold would far exceed their expectations once again.\nChasca contemplated and discovered ever more combat techniques, as if there was always some voice in the dark guiding her on, showing her more ways to fight.\nBut the longer she followed this voice, the less willing she became to skulk in the shadows. She became obsessed with seizing the initiative, with matching herself against bird and beast alike.\nBrown Deer, Flying Squirrels, Halberd-Crest Birds, each in their turn she would eagerly challenge. Rather than being a huntress skilled in the singular, fatal ambush, she was more akin to an unyielding warrior, one who sought battle and would find rest only in death.\nBut the more addicted she became to the thrill of the fight, the less prey she would obtain — for animals tend to be the vigilant sort, and having recognized in her a formidable foe, they naturally choose to flee at the first chance.\nYoung Chasca thus faced a quandary: the intoxication of battle, or a full stomach...\nAnd what an impossible choice that seemed to her then!"

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 3</color>\nUnlike other human children, Chasca's first word was neither \"mama\" nor \"papa.\"\nWhen her adoptive human father Cusco first laid eyes on her, he took one look at her, her eyes feral and fierce as her teeth tore into raw meat, then stared back at Elder Allpa, who was planning to give her to him, and his jaw dropped so far you could have stuffed a whole Saurian egg into his mouth.\n\"Um, Elder... I know I agreed to take an orphan in... but, you didn't say it was an orphaned Qucusaurus!\"\nGiven the frequency with which Natlan faces Abyssal invasions, it was not uncommon for war orphans to be adopted, but one like Chasca, abandoned by humans and adopted by Saurians... That was the stuff of legends, and legends alone.\nAs events would prove, Cusco had in fact underestimated the destructive might of this \"Qucusaurus.\" Qucusaurs were already well-known for doing things their own ways, but Chasca's temper would prove harder to restrain than even the proudest among that race of Saurians.\n\"That vulture! She's stolen meat from the warehouse — again!\"\n\"My house isn't your damn nesting ground, you little vulture!\"\n\"Damn.. the little vulture's started another fight!\"\nWorse still, Qucusaurs usually had some specific intention behind their actions. To obtain food perhaps, or to defend their territory... but little Chasca seemed set on kicking up trouble for its own sake. She had food far more delicious than raw meat set before her at the table, and her bed was far softer than a roost of straw, but still she would constantly stir up conflict, day and night.\nThis really had Cusco's brows all knitted up. He had realized that this might not be some simple wildness of temper, or an inability to adapt to her new circumstances... But what was the root of it?\nHumans would die for money, and monsters for food, but this? This pursuit of conflict without gain, without negotiation, without anything but a desire for destruction? Only one other example sprung to mind — the Abyss.\n...Perhaps it was time to have a good \"talk\" with his daughter.\nAnd so, when Chasca next got herself in hot water, only barely restrained by two elite members of the flying squad, Cusco hurried over to apologize once more for not watching over her carefully enough, then rubbed his forehead in exasperation and asked:\n\"...Now, what do you want? If you never speak up, no one will ever understand.\"\n\"The hell are you even asking her for, Cusco? This vulture can't even say a single damn word! Seriously, what were you and the Elder thinking...\"\nLittle Chasca glared venomously at the flying squad members holding her down, a growl forming in her throat, before it warped into a single hoarse \"word\":\n\"V... Vultures!\"\n...Well, that was a start, Cusco thought with a wry smile. As far as communication went, a counter-insult still counted."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4</color>\nThe lamp shone upon Chasca's sleeping face, the light of the flames trembling across the faces of Cusco and the shaman standing to one side.\n\"The Abyss has a foothold in her soul, and its claws have engraved conflict into her. This wound can only grow worse with the passing years... This is an ominous sign, and something that we have never before seen.\"\nThe shaman sighed, thinking for a moment, before speaking again, words weighty and considered.\n\"...Perhaps it might be best for all if we took this chance to return her to the forest now.\"\nCusco could hear the implied meaning. Dealing with Chasca was hard enough now, and she was still little now. Who knew what she might be like in the future?\nThe Abyss was ever Natlan's nemesis, and to keep her in the tribe was to house a potential calamity.\nBut unless they were to find some way to restrain the Abyss within... a \"return to the mountains\" was but a euphemism for \"abandoning her to her fate.\"\nChasca's desire for battle was inborn, just as all humans are born with a desire for food. Others fought for a reason, and once their objectives were achieved, there was no further need to push themselves further.\nBut Chasca's yearning was as a bottomless hunger. Even the sweet taste of constant victory could only sate her for so long.\nIf that craving could not be contained... then perhaps her fate would be to destroy all around her until nothing remained, or be slain in some fierce battle.\n\"You must make your decision... 'now.'\"\nThe shaman's words leapt about in the darkness like the candle's flame.\nCusco looked at little Chasca. Her breathing even, her snoring light, she seemed so much more at peace asleep — indeed, no different from any ordinary human girl.\nCusco softly ruffled her hair, mumbling: \"No. It's too late now... It's too late.\"\n...\nChuychu, having woken up in the dead of night, was hiding behind the door, where the light could not reach.\nYoung as she was, she did not comprehend all that was said between the two — yet the leaden air and her father's sorrow would remain in her heart all the same."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 5</color>\nAfter that, Chuychu's parents would often take long trips from home. One day, it'd be to go see an elder living in seclusion; the next, to gather a legendary herb.\nEach time, one of them would have the other stay behind to keep an eye on things, but when emergencies cropped up, they would both rush off in a hurry, leaving young Chuychu behind with an \"elder sister\" who was mentally younger than her.\nFortunately, Chasca appeared to have become much better behaved since learning the word \"vulture.\" At least now, when she had some minor disagreement with someone, she could open up with some insults rather than going straight to delivering a beating.\nPerhaps, Chuychu could not help but wonder, Chasca had even realized that no one would apologize for her and clean up her messes while their parents were gone.\n...Probably not. With her personality, there was no way she knew how much their parents worried for her... or how well they treated her.\nChuychu had once imagined what life would be like if she had an elder sister — a playmate, a sharer of woes, someone to care for her when she fell ill...\nBut since Chasca had arrived, her father had become so busy, and her mother's free time had evaporated. Even those her age who she used to play with now avoided her, intentionally or not.\nThis was all Chasca's fault—\nChuychu shook her head frantically as that thought flashed through it.\nNo. She couldn't think like that. The elders said that the tribe must be united, and her parents had also said that Chasca actually really deserved their sympathy...\n...But if she weren't around...\n\"Hey! You home, Cusco? Chasca got into another fight!\"\nThe sudden commotion cut that train of thought short.\nShe rushed to the scene in place of her father, only to find Chasca, her face the very picture of fury, alongside a group of wailing children, among whom were many of her former friends.\n\"These... vul...\" Chasca lifted her hand to point at the pile of crying children.\n\"Another fight? Really!?\" The thoughts that Chuychu had just dispelled came blazing back. \"You're always like this. That's why... That's why they don't play with me anymore! That's why Mom and Dad don't spend time with me anymore!\"\n\"Vul... tures...\" Chasca unconsciously lowered her pointing hand, and though her mouth still repeated those words in grunts, her voice grew quieter and quieter.\n\"You're the worst vulture here!\"\nAt last, the words Chuychu had hidden in her heart tore forth.\nChasca's eyes widened, her lips quivering as if to say something. Then, she finally cast her eyes to the ground, turned, and ran off in the direction of the wilderness outside the tribe.\n...She'll be alright, Chuychu thought. This isn't the first time she's run off. They just needed to go look for her later.\nBut for some reason, deep down, she felt a sense of unease.\n\"What happened back there with Chasca? She seemed much better lately... What did you all say to set her off?\" An adult who had arrived on the scene muttered.\nThe children who had been beaten looked at one another, hesitant to speak. A moment later, someone raised their hand, and said with a trembling voice:\n\"We... It was just an argument at first! But then, someone said...\"\n\"Someone said that Uncle Cusco and his whole family... were also idiots for... keeping this vulture in our tribe... We were just joking, I swear! A—And we heard that from the adults!\"\n\"And they also said not to play with Chuychu... just in case her sister's sickness is contagious...\"\nShocked, Chuychu whirled around, facing the direction Chasca had disappeared in.\nBut there was nothing between the mountains save the mournful wind, giving howling voice to some cry for which there could be no words."

Wear things. Spend a few not-so-cold nights among them.'\n'I could go back any time. That's right. I'll go back to my nest.'\n'Mom might chase me out again, but Sister will speak for me.'\n'The \"sickness\" hurts. But it can hurt all it wants. I don't need humans to \"cure\" me.'\nSuch were the chaotic thoughts that swirled through her mind.\nWell-practiced leaps carried her aloft from tree to tree as she drunk in the fresh, familiar mountain air and scent of the leaves. Still, she could not forget the flickering fires of the tribe's candles.\n'I don't need fires to keep warm. I don't need fire to light up the night. Mom and Sister never did either.'\n'Humans are weak. They fear the cold night, so they light fires. Proud, strong Saurians don't need that.'\n...And yet, the fire was so warm.\nThese cowardly thoughts stole into her mind, and suddenly, they echoed and rang, stopping her cold with a splitting headache. She plummeted out of the trees.\n—\"It\" was here again.\nGritting her teeth, Chasca pulled herself up against the tree, her trembling fingers scratching bloody trails across the branches.\n'Fight. Bite. Destroy. That way, you can forget all your unhappiness.'\n'Forget the cowardliness this brief stay has forced upon you. Forget those chains that the human world has bound you with, all their rules. All things were born wild! Born beasts!'\nShe had heard that voice for as long as she could remember. At first, it had merely guided her to hunt, to bite into her prey. But then, it came more frequently, its noise leaving her dizzy and faint, release only coming after she gave in and made a mess.\n'Mom sent me to the humans... hoping that they could cure me, didn't she?'\n'But it's no use. The human world is noisier than the nest. Humans disagree and fight all day. They are always in conflict. And \"its\" voice gets clearer when they fight. More tempting.'\n'—Sister, I don't want to disappoint Mom, but...'\nChasca had tried to confide in her elder sister on several occasions, but alas, her human tongue could not make the vocalizations of a Qucusaurus.\n'—And you, I know you all don't want me to fight, but...'\nChasca had also tried to communicate with Cusco and his wife, but a Qucusaur child could not form human words.\n'—They deserved that beating! They scolded me! They scolded you, too!'\nChasca had tried to explain herself to Chuychu, but only that tattered word, \"vulture,\" came stumbling out of her mouth.\n'Never mind them! I can hear you, and you can hear me. That is all you need!'\n'No need to explain. No need to understand! Just break everything that hurts you! Tear apart all that stands in your way!'\nEven now, that voice screamed in her head, rounding on her.\n'—Enough! You're the one I hate the most! You're the biggest, the worst, the most loathsome vulture of them all!'\nChasca all but roared as she pounded, pounded, pounded her fists against the tree, as if she might rip that voice out and bash it into a pulp!\nSplinters of bark and leaf sprayed out every which way, swirling in the air, but \"it\" laughed all the more wildly.\n...\nMoon-silver pierced through the trees, its mottled gleam lighting Chasca's pallid face.\nShe collapsed, her fists a mess of split skin and muddied flesh, exposing the white bone beneath in some spots.\nEverything hurt. She could not move. Her eyelids were so, so heavy. Even the voice in her head was all but spent.\n'Of course it would be. \"It\" is dying, because \"it\" is me.'\n'This isn't far from the human tribe, and there's so much tree cover. Mom and Sister won't be able to find me, will they?'\nCusco and his wife were out. There was no way they'd return in time to find someone who'd run away from home.\nNo one would know that Chasca was about to die here.\n...And that was fine. One less vulture in the world, Chasca forced herself to think — not to mention the even bigger vulture within.\n...The moonlight was a little too cold after all, though.\n...\nDimly, she felt some warmth on her face, like the light cover of Mom's wings, like the light of human candles. Chasca opened her eyes slowly.\nBefore her was a humble bonfire, and a young girl squatting and tending it carefully — Chuychu.\n\"...Ah!\" Realizing that Chasca was awake, Chuychu hastily hid her hands behind her back. In the firelight, Chasca could see that her hands had been slightly burned.\n\"...Are your hands okay?\" Chuychu deflected.\nOnly then did Chasca notice the bandages wrapped snugly around her hands. It was clumsy work, but enough to stop the bleeding.\n\"...I couldn't move you, so I had to make do here... But I've lit a fire, so the adults should find us soon enough.\"\nChasca did not answer, but the question her eyes asked was clear.\n\"...Well, Mom and Dad would be sad if something happened to you.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Also... Thanks for standing up for me. I'm sorry for yelling at you before asking what happened.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Anyway... Let's go home, okay?\"\n\"...Home...\" Chasca broke her silence, mumbling the new word she had just learned. Then she nodded. \"...Let's 'go home.'\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4</color>\nThe first time the Flying Captain, Elder Allpa, came forward to teach Chasca, it was because her front door had been virtually blocked up by the deluge of complaints about Chasca and the beatings she'd handed out.\nBut no matter how long Allpa spent laboring over explanations of the human world and its laws, little Chasca could never understand what was wrong with fighting.\nSaurians and beasts all decided things through strength. She'd won the fight, so why was she the one being questioned?\nAllpa would talk and gesticulate, while Chasca would study her, wondering if she might be spared the lengthy lectures if she could simply defeat the Elder.\nBut the second time she came to give Chasca guidance, she immediately realized that there was something different about the girl's gaze.\n\"...Teach me. Become strong.\" With those choppy words, Chasca asked to learn human ways. \"Abyss... want to defeat.\"\n\"...Alright. In that case, let me teach you to use humanity's greatest weapon.\"\nSo saying, Allpa grabbed a woven scroll, an exquisite line of small words embroidered at its head: \"Peacemaker — the Art of Communication.\"\n\"Our greatest weapon is our language.\"\nBut what did flapping one's lips have to do with strength? Chasca did not quite understand.\nShe would rather learn how to use various weapons, from bows to guns, or perhaps how to use Phlogiston, or how to shoot while in the air.\nIf one was strong enough, talk could be dispensed with... That was how she had thought in the past, at least.\nBut still, she had not been able to tear that voice from her heart and beat it until it stopped talking ever again.\nSo she endured, learning every last word that Allpa taught her, chewing on that woven scroll that she never thought she would read, bit by bit, line by line.\nAs it turned out, when she learned to communicate, coordinate, and rely on others, the efficiency of her hunts seemed to increase — just as the scroll had said.\nWhen she wrote Chuychu a letter on her birthday and wished her well, she and their parents seemed pleasantly surprised — just as the scroll had said.\nAnd when she took part in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, bearing the expectations of all on her shoulders, it seemed as if the people of the Flower-Feather Clan looked upon her with a little more respect — just as the scroll had said.\n...\n\"Here you go. The highest possible caliber, and the greatest possible mobility... If this request had come from anyone else, from someone whose abilities I wasn't so sure of, I'd have used the materials they gave me to beat some sense into them.\"\n\"Thanks, Xilonen. This should make me a more persuasive mediator.\" Upon receiving the almost comically huge \"Soulsniper: Ritual Staff,\" Chasca tested its weight using the reins in her hand.\n\"I'll say... Who'd disagree with you after being hit with this thing, anyway? This has to be the strongest weapon I've ever made for your tribe.\"\n\"...No, 'a bullet has the most power when it has yet to leave the chamber.'\"\nAs she caressed the cylinder of the gun, this analogy that Chasca had encountered in a certain woven scroll came back to her, unbidden.\n\"The strongest weapon, huh... Then, from this day forth, we shall be the 'Peacemakers.'\""

Long have we fought, with neither of us able to overcome the other... But come, let us end this. Approach me, embrace me... and the greatest strength shall be yours.\"\nAs the battle wore on, the more monsters Chasca slew, the greater the hold the Abyssal power had over her, and once more, she felt her battle lust growing ever greater.\nEager were her steps as she sought another target to slay, spent casings and corpses alike piled up at her feet.\nOn that horrific battlefield, the illusion with its outstretched hand seemed almost like an envoy bringing peace.\nBut instinct brought Chasca's gun up and level with it. This was her best chance. It was time to reduce this hateful voice to a bloody mess, once and for all.\n\"So you'll kill me, then? But who will understand you, who will keep you company... if not me?\"\nMore phantasms emerged and rushed her, bringing the feelings she'd kept buried back into the open:\nOnce, she had been dropped like a hot potato, alienated by all.\nShe was no Saurian, but she was not \"human\" in any normal sense, either. She had a \"home,\" yet she walked a solitary path.\nNone could understand the anxiety that seared her heart, nor put out that roaring fire.\nThat illusion was like a vision of water after a parched travail through the desert.\nCould she really put an end to this endless conflict, right here and now?\nAs she walked forward, step by step, the power of the Abyss enshrouded her, and she shivered and grew faint. Yet this feeling was also familiar, like that of an infant returning to their mother's embrace.\nShe had once been abandoned. Was this where she had always belonged?\n...\nBut just as she was about to touch that apparition, voices filled with warmth called out from behind her.\n\"Hey, Sis. Leave a note next time you leave home, alright?\"\n\"You're free to choose your own path in life, but remember, you'll always have a home here with us.\"\n(\"Why have you even come back here? You've chosen to live with humans, haven't you?\")\n(\"Coya's just prone to harsh words. We all miss you, really...\")\nShaking her head, Chasca stopped moving.\nOnce, she had blindly followed the voice in her heart, hungering for battle and for greater strength.\nEven now, it was true that she still walked alone out of habit, but she now knew the meaning of the bonds she'd forged as a \"human.\"\nRaising her gun once more, she took aim, and let fly with all the bullets she had in it.\nThe phantom shattered like a mirror when struck, red ichor seeping between the shards.\n\"Hah, you hypocrite... You say you wish to stop fights, and yet you raise your gun to me. How pathetic.\"\nThe apparition vanished like smoke, leaving only a hollow voice that rang in her ears.\n\"No. I know 'you' too well. That's why I'm sure that this is the only way to make peace between us.\"\nChasca ejected the spent shell casings, and prepared to reload, only for a \"bullet\" to drop to the ground, tinkling as it did.\nLowering her head, she saw that it was a Vision, shining with its own light.\nPicking it up, she flicked it into the air with her thumb before catching it.\n\"Bring it on, then. No matter how many disputes await, I'll pacify them all... 'You' included.\""

Then, once she started working on it in earnest, she spent an entire day questioning me — what would a typical day's flying look like, how often I was expecting to use it, and so on — and by the end of the day, there were abandoned designs schemes all over the floor... I was so exhausted that I fell asleep even before she did.<br>Then she wrote a whole maintenance guide, which she forced me to learn by heart so I wouldn't come bugging her with issues every day... Well, that's what she said. But I suspect her real reason was that she wanted to make sure I'd look after myself and fly safe.</p>",
