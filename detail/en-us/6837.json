This explains how it is possible to attempt to create Artifacts through sacred writings. Legend tells of an instance where seventy sages independently produced identical translations of the same source text; and thus, the original text was considered to be sacred. A person has only to place their hand on this machine and the story behind the Artifact will naturally flow out of it.</p>",
