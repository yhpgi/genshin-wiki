The collision between energies of different properties causes annihilation and the production of greater energies â€” it is this principle that powers many clockwork meka. Of course, the power supply of these meka is unstable, resulting in Pneuma or Ousia-aligned energy states. Attacks with the opposite alignment can be used to overload and disable their power supplies."
