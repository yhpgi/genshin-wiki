Too much grief has flowed through the waters already.\"\n\"I ask but one thing of you, noble warrior — take this conflict away from this land.\"\n\"Taint these pure waters with 'death' no longer. Let us preserve our final home.\"\nConquering youths often believe their bodies and hearts as tough as the marble that adorns city walls.\nBut just as all kingdoms must fall into silence, the agitated strings added dissonant notes to the hero's poetic saga...\nMillennia of shifting legends and theatrical edits have given this tale all manner of extended developments.\nIn some versions, the hero, who once subdued cities and nations unnumbered, heeds the words of the fairy maiden.\nHe accepts the proffered bow from her hands and sounds the withdrawal, only to be slain en route by conniving traitors, his body consigned to the ocean depths.\nIn other tales, the illustrious Aurelius falls into agonizing, maddening love, he leads his army into the pine forest,\nSeeking her out, yearning to see her once more and make her his lover, that she might stay by his side.\nThe young maiden flees to the riverbank, weeping as she appeals to her pure-water mother to save her from the obsessions of the hero.\nThe ruler of the Many Waters took pity on her fate, turning her into a pine tree.\nThen, the bowstring that once shot love into Aurelius snapped like the heart the arrow had struck, and it fell by the maiden's side in silence, sinking into the countless blooming Pluie Lotuses.\nThe pained young hero stared at the flowers in the water and would not leave, eventually falling into a deep pool...\nNatural philosophers who came after would claim that according to their research, a barbarian tribe named Dryas had once settled here,\nWhich led to the pine forest being named as such. Such unromantic explanations have never had much to do with theater.\nWhether he met his end sinking into the deep sea, to have his will and desire sanded down by the passage of time,\nOr if he resurfaced after many years, only to be slain by the new White Armada or the Marechaussee Hunters,\nThe tale of the youthful hero ended, and Dryastis too was rendered naught but a legend born from chaotic times.\nAnd as to how this bow, that had so disturbed Aurelius's destiny, came to pass into the hands of someone who dwelled deep beneath the waters after changing hands many times,\nThen be adorned and modified into a theatrical prop for children's performances in that person's homeland... That is a different tale altogether."
