These flowers were called \"Windblume.\"\nIt is believed that the word \"Windblume\" was once a code word for people who wished to stay in contact and plot resistance in secret. At that time, people often said that the stronger the wind blows, the firmer the roots of the Windblume grow, and the brighter the flower that bursts into bloom."

Just as the fate of the Windblume is to bloom under great pressure when the need to arise is most desperate, the fate of this clan will likely never change: they shall ever live in the darkness and bring forth the flame of dawn. A thousand years later, another red-haired warrior, Ragnvindr the Dawn Knight, went to war against the aristocracy of Mondstadt, corrupted by power and wealth. And the heir to the Ragnvindr Clan, Diluc, protects Mondstadt nowadays from all enemies, hiding under the cover of night.\nWhen the tyrant was overthrown and Barbatos came to power over Mondstadt, Windblume became a symbol of freedom, and the Windblume Festival became a day to commemorate the courage and sacrifice of those heroes. But over the years, the history of the festival was forgotten, and the meaning of the word \"Windblume\" acquired a new meaning."

The first camp believes that the Windblume Festival is a tribute to the liberation of ancient Mondstadt from tyranny. Windwheel Asters that turn the wind are the true symbol of Mondstadt's freedom, and the epitome of windmills, which is why traditionalists chose them as their symbol. Many have forgotten the history of the festival, so this theory is not widespread.\nNowadays, most people are the Dandelionites and believe that the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers and that they should express their love with the most extravagant sincerity during this time. Passionate people in love will often travel to Cape Oath and express their feelings for one another amid the billowing Dandelions and profuse Cecilias. For them, the Windblume means love and gladness. Sometimes, even the forged weapons are adorned with such flowers following the commissioner's or forger's wish."

At this time, even the Adventurers' Guild does not have any commissions, since during the festival, you need to do everything yourself in order to find your love.\nOne of the modern traditions of the Windblume Festival is the capture of foxes. Every Windblume festival, young hunters go to Wolvendom to catch foxes. When they catch one, they place a wreath of flowers on its head and release it.

At the first festival that the Traveler and Paimon attended, they met their old friend the bard Venti, who was dreaming of earning money for a limited supply of new wine. He decided to teach people, who wanted to know the art of love, to write love poems. In order to quickly free himself and try the wine, Venti asked the Traveler and Paimon to help him and promised to send secret signals to determine whether people should keep their distance and take the time or give up outright. The captain of the Knights of Favonius, Kaeya, also decided to write love poems and stated that like any teacher, Venti should be checking his students' homework."

The Traveler and Paimon give Marvin advice about talking to his father and remind him not to forget about Marla herself on the Festival of Love. Then they went to Ellin, a girl who dreamed of becoming a Knight of Favonius. She wanted to bring flowers and a poem to the Acting Grand Master Jean, since she was her main fan. Ellin was worried that the fair, persistent and conscientious Jean would want to give a return gift, which would distract her from important matters. But at the same time, a gift without a signature could arouse suspicion. With Venti's help, the Traveler and Paimon advised Ellin and went to the next citizen. Albert, leader of the Barbara (the Deaconess of the Church of Favonius and the Mondstadt idol) Fan Club, wanted to build a huge flower statue of Barbara and place it near the entrance to the cathedral.\nBy collecting poems from his students and completing various assignments, Venti receives following poems from Kaeya, Timaeus and Bennett:\nKaeya's poem:"

Despite the festive atmosphere, many of the people felt depressed and tired. Beatrice, who had romantic feelings for Quinn and often spent time with him, did not want to go for a walk with him and suggested not seeing each other for a while. The Knight of Favonius, Miles, felt very tired, although the doctors found no illness. And Donna, who was in love with Diluc Ragnvindr, a wine tycoon of Mondstadt, suddenly stopped having feelings for him, but his brother, Kaeya, became her type. They all said that they recently saw something that could have affected them. While the Traveler and Paimon were talking with the receptionist for the Adventurers' Guild, Katheryne, they were approached by Cavalry Captain Kaeya, who asked to meet at the Knights of Favonius headquarters to discuss the events in the city. Inside, they were met by the squad captains who had come to Mondstadt for an important trial. Although almost all the captains had gathered, the Captain of the Investigation Squad, Albedo, was not among them, as it was his case that was being presented at the trial."

Before this trial, the Knights of Favonius, in conjunction with the Church, launched an investigation into Albedo for suspected murder and unlawful disposal of human remains. The prosecution had two witnesses testify that they had seen Albedo bury the bodies, and that teeth and bone had been found near one of the sites. A letter written in the hand of an alchemist was also presented, discussing alchemical processes, decomposition, and extraction. The locations mentioned in the letter matched the witnesses' testimonies, and so Albedo was found guilty at the first hearing. After the trial, the Traveler and Paimon met with the Anemo Archon,\nand his friend Dahlia, who was representing the Archon at the trial. They, along with some other members of the Knights of Favonius, knew of Albedo's artificial origins and did not want this to be revealed at the trial, as people might perceive his nature as the cause of the crime."

The prosecution believed that Albedo had disposed of the bodies using alchemy, but this location was different from the previous two, as if someone had dug the hole instead. After examining all the evidence, the Traveler and Paimon reported it to Jean. During the second trial, the joint investigation team presented new evidence in the case: they found out that the bone belonged to a person and discovered that several residents of Mondstadt had gone missing some time ago, including a resident matching the description of the bones. In addition, the prosecution presented a map with marks that the Traveler and Paimon had found.

Albedo confessed that the map was in fact his and that those places were in fact where corpses were hidden, and that he had buried the body of an intruder on Dragonspine, who had wanted to secretly get rid of him, taking advantage of the deserted location. A battle ensued between them, and Albedo was forced to kill him and bury the body. And although this was irrefutable evidence of guilt for Hertha, Albedo never said that he killed a \"human.\" Albedo's impostor on Dragonspine was a failed experimental specimen left in the stomach of Durin, the alchemist's research subject."

Miles, who had been acting suspiciously for the past few days, could not answer the same question. Albedo knew that the double could change its appearance and add a scar to itself, but such changes could affect its accomplices. All of them fell under the influence of Durin's life force, and their presence prevented the double from acting. If the changes had started, the creatures around would have been affected by this force, and the double would have lost control of what was happening. Realizing that she had trapped herself, \"Hertha\" jumped across the entire hall and escaped, and the knights set off in pursuit."

The events of the past few days were part of a plan that the Knights Favonius had been preparing for half a year. They had long been monitoring the resurgence of Durin's life force and how the monsters became more aggressive under the influence of the corrupting power. When the alchemist first encountered his impostor several years ago, he killed it and buried it in the snow, but the monsters dug up its body and returned it to Durin's stomach. Having absorbed the emotions, memories, and powers of the impostor, Durin realized that he was no longer the only and perfect creation of his mother, so he felt pain and decided to get rid of Albedo. From the impostor, he learned the ability to transform their appearance, and the monsters he spawned could take on someone else's appearance. During his observations, the alchemist noticed that many of those who dared to go to Dragonspine returned different. Some simply fell under the influence of Durin's power, while others fell victim to the monsters that took their appearance and infiltrated Mondstadt. Most of the impostors had no relatives, so their strange behavior went unnoticed. The alchemist killed two monsters that tried to attack people, and also buried one of the monsters' victims. While the trial was going on, monsters began to descend from Dragonspine, and when their\nwas affected, they attacked the city. The impostor was forced to release Durin's power, and everyone who fell under the influence was taken under control."

All the Mondstadters came out to defend their home, and with the support of the Anemo Archon, they defeated the monsters. Despite the victory, Albedo still had a personal matter. He asked Barbatos to arrange a three-way meeting with the Hexenzirkel and told the elder, Alice, that he wanted to do something no one had ever done before: a human transmutation. On behalf of the Hexenzirkel, Alice agreed to Albedo's request and suggested that they meet at a long table in a secret room beneath the library. Before going to Alice, the Traveler and Paimon met Mini Durin, a dragon from the fairytale land of Simulanka. He was created based on the Durin of Teyvat, and their fates were intertwined, causing his life to be just as tragic. When the Traveler and the heroes who had appeared in Simulanka saved Mini Durin, he met Albedo, and they agreed to perform a great feat. Mini Durin wanted to replace Durin of Dragonspine and, through alchemy, be reborn as a human."
