This type of machine, which can transform into numerous shapes, was used by the masters of the ancient ruins to perform various manufacturing tasks. As long as you learn how to use such a machine, you could build a city colossal beyond imagination, even within extreme environments like the depths of a volcano.<br>In addition, it also seems to be able to be used as a weapon. Though the ancient civilization has long since fallen, this machine, shaped like a giant claw and powered by the golden designs engraved on it, can still engage in battle based upon its preset instructions.",
