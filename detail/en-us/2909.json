The pale moon cast its cold light upon the winner and the defeated alike.\n\"Whichever direction the wind blows, there is never a single ripple in the cup of life.\"\n\"The three departed goddesses had long determined the heroes' fate, even if they could never fathom it themselves.\"\nThe wanderer took the moonlit sword, picked up the bloodstained silver coins, and trod in silence toward the distant rainforest.\nThus deprived of Xiphos' protection, the city lost its luster and withered away in the following years.\nIts buildings and gardens were ground down into the dirt along with its destiny, and then the howling desert gales consigned them to oblivion.\nUltimately, the black key and the young prince's quest to rejuvenate his kingdom both sank into the sand's embrace..."
