The heavens collapsed, the earth was split apart, and the civilization now known as Enkanomiya sank into the Dark Sea, hidden from the sight of the gods. This place used to be inhabited by pure elemental beings, the\nwho were forced to leave Teyvat after the war between the Dragons and the Heavenly Principles. There was only darkness in this place, and so their hunting grounds were untrammeled. Upon their arrival at the Dark Sea, the humans drove the Vishaps into the shadows with thousands of lanterns, and the latter hunted humans from the darkness. One day, a man named Abrax revealed his wisdom, and under his leadership, Helios was built, dispelling the darkness. A year after the artificial sun was created, humans tried to find a way to the surface, but the entrance was sealed. Soon after, the nobles seized power and appointed the rule of the\ndeclaring Abrax a traitor. During the tyranny of the Sunchildren, humans formed a resistance, but it fell apart after their leader was captured. It was only when the god Orobashi, who had fled to the Dark Sea from the Archon War, appeared in Enkanomiya that the people were able to overthrow the rule of the Sunchildren and the nobles. During his reign, the Serpent began to experiment on the Dragonheir of the Depths, grafting his corals onto them. Orobashi's appearance meant that the ban on leaving the Dark Sea was weakened, and the people could rise to the surface. After making an agreement with Inazuma, Enkanomiya began to prepare for the great migration, learning the Inazuman language and traditions. Since then, the underwater kingdom has been called Enkanomiya, as opposed to Sangonomiya, which rises above the sea. The island that the Enkanomiyans landed on was called Watatsumi, which means \"god of the sea.\""

        "text": "When the Enkanomiyans emerged on the surface, the Holy Soil began to spread across Sangonomiya, expanding the habitat of the Dragonheir of the Depths and strengthening the primordial elemental power of the three realms. It was believed that just as the human heart runs deep and water flows downhill, the spirit of Watatsumi Island constantly feels the call of Enkanomiya, down in the depths. As a result, the soil slowly bleaches, becoming Holy Soil. Every few hundred years, when the spirit veins flowed smoothly, people would break the barrier between Enkanomiya and Sangonomiya, descend into the underwater kingdom, and retrieve the Jade Coral Branch left behind by Orobashi, which was used to suppress the Dragonheir of the Depths. They would then use the Jade Coral Branch to perform the\nritual, thus causing the sunken \"spirit\" to return, which would stop the erosion of the Holy Soil. A variation of the phenomenon existed in Natlan, where phlogiston-rich soils were suppressed using divine nails. The spread of the Holy Soil on Watatsumi is probably related to the geological structure of the island. As the seawater is absorbed, the land becomes dry and solid, the salt displaces nutrients, and the soil becomes inert to the elements and unsuitable for farming. And the Coral Branches contain the power of Orobashi, which can restore the elemental nature of the soil and reverse the effect of bleaching. The Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri ritual is essentially designed to use the serpent god's life force to awaken its second familiars: the Sangacorallia. They are creatures that break down raw, primitive elemental energy into the milder elemental energy of the human realm, and their mass awakening causes a transformation in the ecological environment of Enkanomiya. The giant coral is a symbol that the Sangacorallia have been awakened by the serpent's blood."

After removing the seal and obtaining the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep, they opened the entrance to Enkanomiya and descended into the underwater kingdom. There, in the library, they met a strange man named Enjou, which means \"above the depths.\" He introduced himself as a scholar who was sent by someone to help the Traveler and Paimon translate ancient texts. Using his clues, the Traveler and Paimon were able to find the Golden Bridle to remove the protective barrier from Helios and activate the artificial sun. But despite the help he provided, Enjou was acting suspicious and untrustworthy, and one of the Shades of Tokoyo reported that the scholar had the power to dispel his existence. When the Traveler and Paimon found all the fragments of the Reins of Revival needed to open the passage to the Bathysmal Vishap Herd and defeated them, removing the Bloodbranch Coral from them, Enjou suddenly appeared. It turned out that he was an Abyss Lector from the Abyss Order, and his main goal in Enkanomiya was to find the forbidden book \"Before Sun and Moon,\" in which he wanted to find information about Celestia's alien origin. Enjou couldn't find the book in the library or anywhere else, so he assumed the Traveler had it and attacked. When he failed to win the fight, he disappeared, and the Traveler and Paimon rose to the surface to give the Bloodbranch Coral to the Divine Priestess.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Since they lived among humans, they gradually began to resemble them in everything except for their snake pupils, the main distinguishing feature of the Vassals. After Orobashi spent all his strength on creating Watatsumi Island, no more Vassals of Watatsumi were born. However, there is a mention in the records of the last of the Vassals, who was supposed to be the link between the dragons and humans. When she was just an infant girl, she and her guardian shrine maiden were attacked by Vishaps at the border of Enkanomiya, who then raised the girl. The medallion with intertwined snakes belonged to the beginning of the era when Orobashi reorganized the court and reformed Enkanomiya. The three pendants were given to the Dainichi Mikoshi, the Sangonomiya lineage, and the Vassals of Watatsumi. The original intention was that the common folk, the officials, and the divine vassals would all hold each other accountable. Tsumi's medallion fragment was a perfect match for the fragments from Sangonomiya and the Dainichi Mikoshi, only because she was the last Vassal of Watatsumi, but she refused to accept this and returned to the Dragonheir of the Depths."

The passage to the ancient civilization is hidden behind a huge door with Key Sigils. These five types of sigils were once used throughout Enkanomiya and only surfaced when the passage was opened. According to legend, with the awakening of Enkanomiya, a new set of sigils will be given to the people of Watatsumi. By activating all the Key Sigils, a gate opens that leads deep into the rock that previously seemed solid. At the end of the passage, the path to Enkanomiya is blocked by doors that can only be opened with a Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep. This key is said to be forged from the spilled blood of Orobashi and can only be used by those with a heart as pure as water itself. The Traveler and Paimon were sent to Enkanomiya by the High Priestess of Sangonomiya to obtain the Bloodbranch Coral needed to perform the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri ritual to stop the Holy Soil spreading on Watatsumi Island."

Thousands of years ago, before Orobashi appeared in Enkanomiya, there was a resistance against the tyranny that ruled civilization. When their leader was captured, the core of the resistance completely fell apart. The ordinary students who followed him were saved by being far from the epicenter of events. Those who were lucky enough to escape fled to previously prepared shelters, hoping to regain their strength. They believed that they needed time, and they would be able to lead the movement again. But everything required money, which they did not have, so someone suggested selling the Dragonbone Orbs. Its aroma could relax and calm anxious thoughts, sweeping away all worries, so it was expensive on the market. The recipe brought real wealth to the resistance, but soon some of the members began to avoid conflicts and battles, and later asked for permission to leave their ranks, since there was no longer a reason to fight. The collected Dragonbone Orb can be exchanged with Marjorie of Mondstadt, Linlang of Liyue, or Mikoshi Genichiro of Inazuma, but only Marjorie has heard the legend of the Fretnaught Fruit."

The descendants of the Iwakura Clan never obtained a Vision, so their excellent swordsmanship was purely a result of their honing of mind, body, and technique. The Clan's secret blade technique was called Tengu Sweeper, and people said it can only be performed when there is not a single trace of confusion in one's heart. This blade once belonged to the clan's only heir, who received a Vision, Iwakura Mitsunari. When Iwakura Mitsunari lost his Vision during the Vision Hunt Decree, he disbanded his disciples, and they took up the path of the Kairagi. When they attacked the Traveler, the latter was forced to defeat them, and during the Traveler's meeting with Iwakura, the swordsman wanted to avenge his fallen disciples, but was also defeated. The blade left by the Iwakura master can be returned to the Blade-mound on Narukami Island, where the swords of fallen samurai are left."

To do this, one must restore the Reins of Revival and claim this land as one's own. The Reins of Revival, or rather the \"Reins of recovery of control over things that return from beyond the grave,\" like the Golden Bridle, were a national treasure of Enkanomiya. It was made of the same material as Helios and could make dark spirits speak and search for Key Sigils nearby. The three parts of the Reins are fastened to the Bridle to remove the seal from The Emanant Skylight and ascend to the Gate of Heaven, where the trial is conducted. This opens a passage under the high tower where the Bathysmal Vishaps are located, from whose bodies the Bloodbranch Coral must be extracted. These Vishaps have been modified specially so that fragments of Bloodbranch Coral can take root on them, but these changes also make them exceptionally large."

In addition, near the Dainichi Mikoshi is the hiding place of Bunkoku, one of the four great puzzles of Enkanomiya. According to one legend, Bunkoku was the second Prime Minister in the history of Enkanomiya. He and the Sunchild bled the people white through heavy taxation and made a huge fortune. After that, he hid his treasure in a secret chamber inside the Dainichi Mikoshi. Finally, he concealed the treasure chamber using the Sunfire Phantasms and summoned vengeful spirits and tainted beings from the Ley Lines to guard it. The secret chamber can be opened using nine stone tablets located in The Narrows, The Serpent's Heart, and the Evernight Temple. When the Traveler and Paimon found all the tablets and solved the puzzle to open the chamber, they discovered a vengeful guardian spirit and a Sinshade of a man named Koyanagi. He and his friend set out for the treasure chamber, but Koyanagi was possessed by one of the vengeful spirits summoned by Bunkoku and attacked his friend."

It was in this laboratory that they tried to transplant Orobashi's Bloodbranch Corals to the Dragonheir of the Depths, but at first they were rejected, since the serpent belonged to the Human Realm, and the Vishaps to the Light Realm. The researchers found out that the Vishaps were capable of evolution. They tried to lower the temperature in the habitat of young heat-resistant Vishaps, and as a result, the grown Vishaps were weak, but their offspring had a high percentage of body fat, slept more, and possessed the Cryo element. Some Vishaps received the Electro element, but none of them developed traits indicating the Pyro element. It is not known whether this had any effect, but in Natlan, the Pyro Vishaps lost the primal flame's purity due to evolution and gradually disappeared. The researchers made an educated guess that the Bathysmal Vishaps had the ability to awaken their \"seed\" before maturation freely, and their mothers can also create new \"seeds\" to pass on to their offspring if they encounter unprecedentedly difficult living conditions. During experiments to determine the intelligence of the Vishaps, it was discovered that the fourth-generation Vishaps had linguistic understanding comparable to that of a 12-year-old child. After this, many of the laboratory staff advocated for such experiments to be stopped. According to the prophecy, the Hydro Sovereign was to be born in human form, and this could not be allowed to happen in Enkanomiya. It is unknown whether Orobashi's experiments affected the fulfillment of the prophecy, but the Hydro Dragon appeared in Fontaine in the body of a man named Neuvillette."

And the greed of those who stood behind the throne knew no bounds. They grew fat on the labor of people, controlling the Sunchildren, pushing them to disgusting deeds.

The temperature of the Dainichi Mikoshi is such that its light can warm all of Enkanomiya, so the Sunchildren were reduced to fragments of souls that returned to the Locus.

To build it, he studied the book \"Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku\" from the library and learned everything about the supporting structures, underground space, potential problems with water leakage, and even took into account the principles of Feng Shui. His labyrinths are based on interactions with triangular mechanisms that can be activated by attacks from a certain distance, daises of day and night, and places of essence worship. The places of essence worship are divided into Suncores and Mooncruxes. They each contain the power of Whitenight and Evernight, and are capable of bestowing such powers upon those who come to pay obeisances. With this energy, it is possible to activate the mechanisms in the opposite state at the time of day. It is possible to switch Evernight to Whitenight with special mechanisms using the Golden Bridle of Enkanomiya. Shield-Lights of Tokoyo present during Whitenight are dispelled during Evernight and vice versa, and Sunfire Phantasms can dissipate or manifest when switching between day and night.

According to the beliefs of those times, Enkanomiya is a crossroad between three realms: the Light Realm, the Human Realm, and the Void Realm, so at the three corners, the Kunado, Yachimatahiko, and Yachimatahime's Loci, the Towers of the Three Realms, were built to harmonize the three worlds. Originally, these places were guard posts against the Vishaps and were also a spiritual hub for the three forces that intersected in Enkanomiya. Their ancient names were lost over time, and they were renamed after the arrival of Orobashi. The triangle between these towers was a place of protection where people could live in safety from the Dragonheir of the Depths. The Towers of the Three Realms were built in places that were not aligned with either the wind or the water, in order to stabilize the tendencies of Enkanomiya and control its winds and waters. Because these places were extremely important and if they were to be threatened, the entire nation would suffer, they were hidden using secret arts, and only the priestesses and divine vassals were able to summon them. Some time after the Traveler obtained the Bloodbranch Coral, Enkanomiya was engulfed by the darkness emanating from the Void Realm, and the towers were damaged. Thanks to the unexpected help of one of the creatures of the Void Realm, the towers were restored, as was the protected space between the Towers of the Three Realms."
