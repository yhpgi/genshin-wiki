Rage, in turn, did blunt their mind,\nTheir folly sullied the seas, whence the demons multiplied:\nA demonic infestation thus engendered by the fallen souls.\nFive yaksha guardians His Majesty task'd with evil to defeat,\nTo rid the world of poisonous rage with which the demons seethed.\nMountains shook as yaksha wrath with golden splendor burned,\nBut though they purged the evil, alas! One alone returned:\nAlatus, by whose talons foes were quashed and peace procured.\nA peace that harked to days gone by was the peace that now endured.\nPeace restored, adepti back to Jueyun Karst ascended.\nDuty fulfilled, yakshas off to unknown corners departed.\nMay this lowly offering departed souls appease.\nAnd may these words by fire's light His Majesty's heart please."
