Indeed, nearby residents have not even heard of her.\nThe signature on the relevant documentation is but a false identity — the real power lies with someone else.\nIf one could hear the children whisper at night behind the Hotel's closed gates, one would hear this appellation: \"Father.\"\nWhen speaking of \"Father,\" some faces turn worshipful, some hearts are seized with fear, and still others look inscrutable, torn — but their tone always becomes one of respect.\nThese children are part of the organization known as the House of the Hearth. They belong to the Fatui.\nThis place is home to orphans the world over, and the luxurious Hotel is but one of the House's faces.\nAs for this \"Father,\" the master of the House, she is none other than The Knave, Arlecchino, presently Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers.\nThe Fatui — and this Harbinger — enjoy a mixed reputation. But to most of these children, \"Father\" is the most important figure in their lives.\n\"It is only because 'Father' is here that this place is truly like a 'home.'\""

Not her hobbies, her dislikes, or the things on her mind when she gazes out to sea.\nEach August, they rack their brains thinking of birthday presents for her, and yet her reactions to each gift are virtually the same.\nThis continued until last year, when Freminet was given a nasty shock by a lizard that leaped down from the ceiling. The little \"invader\" was caught by Lynette's sharp eyes and quick fingers and then imprisoned on top of the table by a bowl she swiftly seized.\nBoth bowl and lizard wound up being taken for that year's gift by The Knave, who just happened to return home at that moment.\nThe next day, when Lyney entered \"Father\"'s office to give a report, he found a familiar figure in the feeding box.\nThe temperature and humidity within the box seemed to be eminently suitable for the little lizard, which seemed to be quite enjoying itself.\n\"Father\" seemed to have experience in rearing reptiles.\nAs The Knave raised her teacup, Lyney immediately shifted his gaze away from the lizard, but he quietly noted this incident to himself.\nThe children seize every opportunity they can to get closer to their \"Father,\" after all.\nThus, Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet began looking up all sorts of knowledge regarding raising lizards, hoping to have something to discuss with \"Father\" when next they saw her.\nBut just a few days later, when he next set foot in her office, the box was already empty.\n\"'Father'... What happened to that lizard?\"\n\"It attempted to open the box lid a few times, so I gave it back its freedom. Our acquaintance was brief indeed, but that was the choice life made.\"\nThe Knave's voice was completely calm. Looking at the confused Lyney, she then directed a casual finger at a bird that was poking about at the windowsill.\n\"Ah, yes. Not long after it left, the lizard became this one's lunch. Now it seems to want me to serve it seconds... Go chase it away.\""

They begin to surreptitious don accessories and trim their split hairs with scissors.\nRebellious little tendencies such as these are of no concern to \"Father,\" nor will she interfere.\nBut should a child reveal their position during a night operation on account of a necklace she would not lay aside — now this would require a \"Father\"'s instruction.\nThus did Arlecchino enter that girl's room, a lovely handbag in hand.\nThe necklace had already been taken off and placed on the table, and the girl stood trembling next to it. She knew her error.\nArlecchino scooped up the necklace and gazed upon it, before walking over and looping it back around the girl's unblemished neck.\nShe then lifted the flowing gold locks around the child's ears. \"Oh, you pierced them yourself.\"\nAnd so \"Father\" once more retrieved velvet ribbon and jeweled earrings from that bag, tying the girl's hair with the former, and affixing the latter to her ears.\nThen, taking her by the shoulders, she guided the girl before the mirror. The young lady reflected within was as a gem-encrusted noble rose, her beauty shining through the unease that blazed across her features.\n\"It is normal to be vain at your age. But do not let these beautiful trinkets arouse vanity and dull your intellect.\"\n\"I'm sorry, 'Father,'\" the young woman anxiously apologized, her terror evident.\nWith quivering hands she reached for the earrings, making to unfasten them. \"It won't happen again, I swear...\"\nBut the mirror showed only \"Father\"'s unwavering calm, her smile seemingly undimmed.\n\"Shh... Do not be so nervous. People often long for that which they cannot have, and it would not do for regret to make beautiful memories seem ever rosier.\"\n\"Wear them. Once you have grown accustomed to them, you will realize that no gem, however exquisite, is any more than an object, cold and dead.\"\n\"This is your new lesson — to understand the source of your emotions.

To her, the unnumbered sacrifices were but an interesting experiment.\n...\nBefore taking the title of The Knave and changing her name to Arlecchino, the young girl had another name: Peruere.\nShe was an orphan of unknown origin, like all others in the House of the Hearth — a \"child\" of their \"Mother.\"\nMany knew that \"Mother\" favored her especially, indeed, caring far more for Peruere than even her own biological daughter, Clervie.\nAs such, even to the last, few understood why Peruere repaid this kindness with a magnificent assassination.\nCrucabena's insane experimentation took place far from prying eyes, so naturally, almost none knew of them.\nPeruere was thus tarred as having committed \"matricide,\" her madness known to all.\n...\nEven after the dust had settled, she who had once been Peruere — and was now Arlecchino — did not offer any explanation.\nShe indulged the spread of these rumors, and indeed added fuel to the fire from the shadows.\nWhether as a diplomat or assassin, one profits most from seeing through the other party while keeping oneself shrouded in mystery.\nA small tombstone stands at the site where she slew their \"Mother,\" the eulogy penned by her hand.\n\"Here the last light of the setting sun lies buried.

But at her young age, this seemed like no ability to be boasted of so much as a deep-rooted curse.\nEach time she let her vigilance wane, this power would run rampant, eating away at her body. First her fingers, then her palms, and then her forearms...\nThe blackened marks were akin to those of burned charcoal, just as she seemed akin to burning firewood.\nHere she had a vague foreboding, that if this dark shadow were to creep up her shoulder, and snake from shoulder to heart, she would likely undergo some sort of \"change.\"\nPerhaps that would be the moment fate tipped its hand to her.\n...\nEven without the corrosion, this flame brought her other troubles.\nThose rendered ash by these fires would leave \"afterimages.\" At times, they were fragments of memory, and at others, they donned the aspect of dazzling colors.\nAs those who fell at her hand increased, Arlecchino began to hear various voices.\nScreams, wails, and hurled recriminations would wake her from dreams, and she soon grew used to this. She had few dreams worth remembering fondly, in any case, filled as most were with crimson moon and barren wilds.\nIn cases few and far between, these afterimages would be complete enough to take on the form of a \"conscious individual.\"\nOf course, these were hardly as special as \"Clervie's shadow,\" but they would still appear by Arlecchino's side, driving the clamor away and buying her a moment's respite.\nLike children at play, they would gather for a time, and then drift away as they pleased.\nArlecchino remembered who they were in life.

Those, I can answer freely and without reservation.\"\nArlecchino did not wholly trust The Jester's open honesty.\n\"Then let me also state that I reject any deliberate mystifications or obfuscations, as well as word games and lies.\"\n\"Most prudent. In that case, allow me to answer the first question weighing on you. Why did we choose you, and why did you accept? 'The naive will die for their ideals, but we are willing to endure even the meanest existence to accomplish our goals.'\"\n...\n\"Question three. What do my constant dreams of a crimson moon and my powers mean?\"\n\"I once served the final dynasty of an ancient underground kingdom. Its dynastic name was 'Eclipse,' and before them came the 'Crimson Moon.' As for the secrets from before your birth... I suggest you purchase a book named 'Hleobranto Innamorato.' I read no such tales in the days when I pursued academic attainment and saw it only by chance. The circumstances depicted are specious, but the key details are accurate.\"\n...\n\"Question five. What will become of me and the others in the House of the Hearth once everything is finished?\"\n\"I will be frank. None of you have any place in my ideals, for I plan only to uphold 'the virtue of folly.' But I can guarantee that our Tsaritsa will once again be a god who loves all humans, and in her ideals shall all human wishes be granted.\"\nThis \"virtue of folly\" was, of course, left enigmatic, but she accepted this answer nonetheless. The Fool had given five answers to her five questions, and the mist that covered her eyes was beginning to part.\n\"Arlecchino.\"\nPierro called out to her as she departed, and she turned around.\n\"Rather than dwelling on how the world is now, you should consider to where it should go.\"\nThe sounds of her departing footsteps as she spun on her heel and kept walking were the only reply."

Boxes sequentially marked with numbers are drawn out on the ground, a sandbag is thrown into one of the boxes, and the player will jump from box to box in a specific order.\nNo one knows when this game began to spread, nor who created the rules, but all young children of the Hearth have experienced being taken by older children to play the game.\nLight-footed leaps, boisterous laughter... The memories married to \"Marelle\" were always wonderful, like the kiss of radiant sunshine.\nAs such, at first the children were perplexed when their \"Father\" was torn between assigning \"At Ease\" or \"Danger\" to that codeword.\nLittle did they know that in the House that came before, Marelle was no game.\nIn those days, each and every child would leap into the boxes one by one under the vigilant eyes of the adults. Stepping out of the lines or breaking the rhythm was not allowed.\nThere was never a need to ask the punishment for making a bad jump, for the area outside of the boxes was lined with upturned blades.\nThose who lost their balance, whose stamina failed, or simply made an error out of fear... So, so many fell beyond the bounds, and the dark-red soil mourned that painful past.\nNone would have associated it with being \"at ease\" — indeed, few could speak of it without blanching.\nYet, after her hesitation, Arlecchino chose \"at ease\" as the codeword's meaning that day.\nMarelle was by then no longer associated with \"danger.\" Now, all that came to mind when this game was mentioned were smiling faces.\nIn which case, she thought, let those unhappy memories dwell in her heart alone.

That was the third time she obtained a source of power.\nBetween these two, the girl who still called herself \"Peruere\" received a Vision.\nWhile Clervie yet lived, Peruere had mooted the idea of assassinating \"Mother\" to her. Perhaps she lacked confidence, or perhaps it was their familial bond that yet shackled her, but Clervie refused.\nClervie's destiny concluded when the cold blade pierced her. But as she slipped away towards death, she was truly happy, for she had finally found her freedom.\nBut for the living Peruere, fate's gears had only begun to turn.\nThe experiment to select a \"king\" was over, but \"Mother\"'s ambitions were far from fulfilled.\nPeruere thus decided to undertake the plan that had once been shelved solo.\nFrom that day on, she silently calculated the gap between herself and \"Mother.\" Her martial skills were the fruit of her \"Mother\"'s tutelage, and the strength flowing through her bloodline was laid bare before \"Mother.\"\nAnd what was a child before adults but a nestling — even one who had emerged as ruler of the roost?\nBut what her life of suffering up till now had not taught her was how to give up.\nThus Peruere constantly honed herself, though her body became riddled with scars from constant battle, though her arms should be burned black from baleful blood-fire she could not completely control.\nThen, on one moonlit night, a Vision came to her without warning or portent.\nThe round Vision lined up perfectly with the moon, and the glimmering gem tinted the latter crimson—\nWas this her wish?\nWas this merely the fruit of hundreds of days and nights of ceaseless thought?\nSuch a question was doomed to remain unanswered, and so she did not obsess over it.\nShe merely concealed the Vision in the place closest to her heart before sending \"Mother\" a \"pleasant little surprise.\"\nAs a Fatui Harbinger, Arlecchino bows before no god. Yet though it represents the institution of The Seven, she always takes meticulous care of this Vision.\nTo her, this is proof of her defiance of fate, wresting from it command over her future."
