During that period, the land of Inazuma was a cozy paradise for the tanuki and every day was a fun-filled festival.\nAt least, that's what the tanuki elders say.\nLater on, the kitsune arrived by sea, forcing the tanuki into a great war that lasted first for 800 years and then for another 800 years, with both sides suffering heavy casualties, until eventually the only option was to hold peace talks. The tanuki are a stubborn bunch and to this day still don't admit defeat, but the fact remains that they ceded the giant Thunder Sakura to the kitsune.\nBut the kitsune are a crafty and cunning bunch too, and equally skilled in the art of shape-shifting. It is said that in that great war, as a consequence of the constant switcheroo trickery, many poor souls became completely disoriented and could not for the life of them keep track of who was who — eventually forgetting even who they were, what they were, and which side they were supposed to be on.\nThus were the hapless mortals born. The product of bewildered youkai.\nThis tale and many others were told to me by the tengu who likes to boast."
