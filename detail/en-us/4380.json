It did not start from a base form before growing larger and stronger, but instead grew limbs and a horn that have no place on an ordinary seahorse. Even its musculature and skeleton have changed. It really seems to resemble a fantastical beast from legends of yore more than its original shape. In the imaginations of poets and authors, even seahorses can frolick upon the earth.</p>",

As such, it is a \"Pearl Seahorse,\" while the suzerain of the Armored Crabs is an \"Emperor.\"</p><p>In the legends and rumors of Fontaine, a brutal war was once waged among the Aberrants of the Fontemer, leaving only the \"Millennial Pearl Seahorse\" and \"Emperor of Fire and Iron\" splitting the great lake into two courts, one ruling over the north, the other the south. In the \"Song of Dobharcu,\" the writer describes the outcome of the war: the great Hunter's Ray known as the Stormlord stirred huge waves in its death throes, causing what is now known by the people as the \"first diluvian period\"...</p><p>Of course, all of this is nothing more than the romantic imaginations of people who are unwilling to accept the bland realities of the world. For the Fontemer Aberrants are in fact just simple aquatic animals, and they have no grand courts nor fallen kingdoms, nor do they possess words meant to exalt or curse.</p>",
