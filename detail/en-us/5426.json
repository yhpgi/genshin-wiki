It's not dangerous, is it?\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> You need to be careful when you're opening packages. I once had a friend mail me some research materials, and all the bouncing around in transit caused a reaction...\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Once I opened it, it let out a stench that could wake the dead.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> If your package contains anything like that, then maybe you should check with Albedo first and see what he thinks.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> No, this package didn't contain any hazardous materials...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Timaeus, Sucrose! What are you two chatting about?\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Oh, hey you two! We're just talking about a strange package that Sucrose received recently.\nAlternative Dialogue: The player has not met Sucrose yet.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Hey, Timaeus! What are you chatting about?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> And... who might this be?\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Oh, hello you two. This is Sucrose.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Hi, I'm Sucrose, Albedo's assistant. If you have any alchemy-related queries, you could always ask me. I'd... do my best to help...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> You don't have to be so nervous!\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Huh? Do I look nervous?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> M—My apologies, I don't get out too often. I'm usually in the laboratory, where there aren't many others to talk to.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> That's okay, you don't have to force yourself! Paimon's sure that once we get to know each other better, we'll become really good friends!\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Traveler... Hey, aren't you the legendary Traveler? The one who repelled Stormterror?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: \"Legendary\" is a bit much.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: I don't even charge for autographs.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Ah! Thank you!\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> I've heard so many stories about you! Always wanted an opportunity to research you up close!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Uhh, what do you mean \"research\"...?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Ah! Sorry, don't mind me. What am I saying...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Well, never mind. So, what were you two talking about just now?\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Sucrose received a strange package recently...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> A strange package?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Yes. I believe it's from a Sumeru scholar who came here to study in Mondstadt. It's most likely a thank-you gift for collaborating on some research together.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Huh, a package from an Akademiya scholar? Then there could be anything inside.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Well, it is a thank-you gift.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> There wasn't anything dangerous inside, just a bunch of strange cards.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> I think I've seen Timaeus with some similar-looking cards before, so I came to ask him about what they might be.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> You've seen me with some cards? Ah, maybe those were the testing cards used for distinguishing reagents?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> No, they didn't look like test cards. Here, have a look...\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Oh, you meant these... Huh, Sucrose, have you really never seen these before?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> No, never. Recently, I've been spending all my time up in the mountains working on cultivating Pentatanic Sweet Flowers. Why, is this an area of research that has started trending in the alchemical community during my absence?\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Haha, you could definitely say that it's trending, but not as an area of research... It's a card game that's been getting really popular these days.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> It's called \"Genius Invokation TCG\"!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Genius Invokation TCG!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: So this is the game we've been hearing about.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Yeah, we've been hearing about this game all over the place, but this is the first time we've ever actually seen any of the cards.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>We didn't know it had made it all the way to Mondstadt. Must be pretty popular, huh?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Genius what now?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Genius Invokation TCG! Haven't you heard of it before?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Apparently it's a game that was invented by a scholar in the Akademiya. People from all over are playing it now!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> That's right. The game's been catching on lately. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has even published a series of light novels based on the game. The story is really good!\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> It starts with a young guy in Sumeru who finds an ancient \"Casket of Tomes\" in the attic. He opens it, and discovers that the soul of an ancient TCG player called the Crocodile King has been captured inside.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> It turns out that the Crocodile King was King Deshret's viceroy, who battled an opponent named the Ibis King. During the match, the Crocodile King fell prey to his opponent's scheme and was sealed away in the Casket of Tomes.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> After being unexpectedly released by the kid, the Crocodile King possesses him and helps him to gradually climb the ranks and become a legendary TCG player.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Uh, Timaeus?\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Huh? What's wrong, Sucrose? Uh, if you're interested in how the story plays out, I can lend you the novels.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> No, I was just thinking about that time you requested an extension on your progress report deadline, citing \"personal reasons\" for the delay...\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Ahem, well... I did go through a phase recently where I wasn't putting enough focus on my work, but it's under control now. I've committed to not even touch Genius Invokation TCG until I've made enough progress in my research.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Aw, well that's unfortunate.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Oh? Why's that?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Well, since it's a gift from a researcher I've collaborated with, I thought that I should at least try to learn the rules. That way, I could say that I at least tried to appreciate his gift.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Ah, right... And since it's a game from Sumeru, who knows, playing it might even make you smarter!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: If you want to play, then just say it.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Okay, fine! Paimon's curious and would like to give it a try! ...Please?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Then you desperately need to play this game.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Oh, just wait until Paimon plays it enough to become smarter than you. Then you'll be sorry!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> ...Although it seems like we can't learn how to play it anytime soon 'cause Timaeus has given up for a while.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Haha, well research is my priority, you know.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> But if you'd like to learn the rules of Genius Invokation TCG, then I'd actually suggest you go to The Cat's Tail.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: The Cat's Tail...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: That's Margaret's place...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Yep, that's the place. It's where everyone in the community goes to play when they have time. They gather there, trade cards... and they're very welcoming to new players.\n<color=#ffffff>Timaeus:</color> Trying to learn the rules can be intimidating at first, but it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Understood. Traveler, Paimon, let's go to The Cat's Tail and try asking around.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> To be honest, hearing Timaeus talking about the game has also piqued my curiosity.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get going!\nQuest Objective: Go to The Cat's Tail\n<color=#ece5d8>The Cat's Tail, Mondstadt</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> <color=#ffffff>So the cards Sucrose received are Genius Invokation TCG cards. Why not try the Genius Invokation TCG and become a player yourself?</color>\nQuest Objective: Talk to Margaret\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Welcome to The Cat's Tail. Ah, it's Traveler and Paimon, what a nice surprise!\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Oh, and Sucrose the alchemist. It's been a while, hasn't it?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Heh...\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> I'm afraid I've already told you before: Fur from The Cat's Tail staff is not for sale, no matter how much Mora you offer.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Ah, don't worry, Margaret, we're not here for that research project I told you about last time.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Uh... What research project?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Fur? From The Cat's Tail staff?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Uh, Sucrose... what kind of experiment were you trying to do at The Cat's Tail?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Oh, I just wanted to test out some hypotheses, and I needed some materials... But, uh, we can talk about that later.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Actually, Margaret, we're here to learn more about Genius Invokation TCG.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose explains everything to Margaret...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Ah, Genius Invokation TCG... We were just talking about that game.\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> You see, more and more people have been gathering at The Cat's Tail to play, so I thought: Why not have a dedicated staff to serve the new customers?\nAdditional Dialogue: The player has completed Margaret's Longing Quest\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Speaking of which, I believe you've already met...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Hmm? Met who?\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> You know, Prince. This is The Cat's Tail, after all, so I thought having a cat take care of our new customers would be quite a nice touch.\n<color=#ffffff>Prince:</color> Meow.\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Ah, allow me to interpret. Ahem, Prince says that the word \"customer\" is much too loose of a term, and we should instead refer to anyone who loves dueling with cards as \"TCG players.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Hmm... my mistake. So it seems I haven't introduced you yet... This is Prince and Shuyun. They will be in charge of taking care of our \"TCG players.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Ah, I'm afraid I must correct you there, Ma'am. Only Prince, the strongest and most formidable TCG player of all, is capable of providing valuable guidance to our new players.\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> The average player is incapable of grasping the subtlety and sheer genius behind Prince's every play, and he has no choice but to rely on me to communicate with everyone. I am merely Prince's lowly assistant, that's all.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Wow, another guy who can understand animals!\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> How can you use such a crude word as \"animal\" to describe the one and only Prince? He is special and the only one of his kind... Such a remark is an insult to Prince!\n<color=#ffffff>Prince:</color> Meow...\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Oh? What's that? \"Shuyun, in the eyes of the common folk, I look no different than any other ordinary cat. It's a natural mistake to make, and you shouldn't overreact.\" Ah, understood... I do apologize.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Hmm, it seems he really is capable of communicating with the cat. Could this be the result of some modification to the language center of his brain?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Seriously, how can he get all of that from a simple meow?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Amazing...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Yes, it was the sacred duels of Genius Invokation TCG that formed and cemented our bonds of mutual understanding. It's my firm belief that by simply playing the game, players can develop a deeper level of understanding between one another.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: That's pretty weird...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> <color=#ffffff73>It was the duels of Genius Invokation TCG that allowed our hearts to bond. It's understandable that ordinary people such as yourselves are unable to comprehend such a thing.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> So playing Genius Invokation TCG fosters some sort of a telepathic link between players?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Hmm... Somehow, Paimon doubts that.\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Uh-huh... Anyway, if you'd like to know anything about Genius Invokation TCG, then please ask Shuyun... Uh, who will ask Prince.\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Though I'd love to explain more myself, it's time for my daily walk. I'll let Prince play a game with you and walk you through all the rules.\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"Just as a seasoned warrior can foresee the path of his opponent's sword, so too can I, as a TCG master, predict my opponent's every play. It would be improper to pit a newcomer to the art of the card against one such as myself, and I must therefore politely decline.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Ahem, that's what Prince said.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Oh, PRINCE doesn't wanna play with us, huh? Fine, then Prince doesn't have to. We'll play you instead!\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> I'm sorry, but from the day I met the mighty cardmaster Prince, I swore an oath that my hands would live solely to hold the cards, and not to play them. I will never play another match of my own again.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Right, Prince's paws probably can't hold the cards...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: What a backstory...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> If Prince is unwilling to play, then I guess we should look for an alternative. How about this... Diona!\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Yeah, blah blah blah, what is it? I'm pretty busy over here, you know!\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Hmph, why is it that every player that sets foot in here to play Genius Invokation TCG has to have a drink... Ugh! Don't they have any clue that the key to playing a game is the ability to think straight?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Seriously, games and drinks don't mix. Don't they get that? Ugh!\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> What can I say... As the tavern owner, I can't help but feel happy to hear this.\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Anyway, I see you've been working hard so I thought you could use a break... So why not come over here and teach these customers the rules of Genius Invokation?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Ha, hahah! Yeah! What kind of break is that? I'd rather not, hmph!\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Oh... why are we letting all these loafers come in here to play Genius Invokation TCG anyway? All it does is encourage more people to come to the bar for a drink...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> *sigh* Ya know, if drinks sales keep going up like this, pretty soon, Mondstadt's alcohol industry is gonna reach new heights...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Grr, looks like my first step in destroying Mondstadt's alcohol industry should be stamping out the spread of Genius Invokation TCG!\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"My dear, you are quite mistaken. You said it yourself — a clear mind is necessary to win. Soon, their thirst for victory will overcome their thirst for alcohol...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Prince speaks the truth, Diona. Not only is the spread of Genius Invokation TCG no obstacle to your goal of destroying Mondstadt's alcohol industry, it could even support you in this endeavor!\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> C—Could it really?\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Sure, why not. Alrighty then, our two customers are waiting to learn... Shuyun, let's put you on drink-mixing duty for now.\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"But Shuyun is destined for a far greater purpose...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Shuyun. Drink-mixing. Now.\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> O—Okay...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Ooo... alright! We'll need some space to learn, heheh. Let's go to that empty table over there.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Prince and Shuyun\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"Diona's waiting for you. Go talk to her and she'll teach you the rules of the game.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> That's what Prince said. sigh And I need to go start mixing drinks. It's a pity that I can't look on while you learn...\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Gary\n<color=#ffffff>Gary:</color> I will surely defeat all my opponents just like how I chase down prey, and I'll become the best Genius Invokation TCG player in no time.\n<color=#ffffff>Gary:</color> ...Hmm? You're interested in the game too? But you're not a player yet, are you?\n<color=#ffffff>Gary:</color> Hehehe... When you become a true TCG player, you might even get the chance to duel me...\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Atra\n<color=#ffffff>Atra:</color> Do you want to be a TCG player, too? If you do, you should have this in mind:\n<color=#ffffff>Atra:</color> It will be I who will become the king of Genius Invokation TCG!\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Belén\n<color=#ffffff>Belén:</color> Hey there, up for a game of cards? Hold on... I don't think you're an official player yet.\n<color=#ffffff>Belén:</color> Come find me once you've become an official player. Perhaps there'll be something I can learn from your mistakes...\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Makri\n<color=#ffffff>Makri:</color> A new player, huh... You can ask Shuyun about the rules of the game, but if there's other things you wish to know...\n<color=#ffffff>Makri:</color> You're always welcome to come and ask.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Nanaya Yuumi\n<color=#ffffff>Nanaya Yuumi:</color> The illustrations on some of the cards are really pretty, don't you think? I'm trying to collect them all.\n<color=#ffffff>Nanaya Yuumi:</color> Beauty is also one form of victory!\nQuest Objective: Go to the empty table to learn the rules from Diona\nQuest Objective: Learn the rules from Diona\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Hehe, okay! Let's go through the rules. First things first, you'll be needing your deck, so place that on the table...\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> A... deck?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Uh, yes? You should have built a deck. You know, a set of cards that meets the bare minimum requirement to play the game...?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Huh-huh... what's with the blank stares? ...C'mon, don't tell me you came to learn Genius Invokation TCG without bringing any cards?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Actually, we do have some cards...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> <color=#ffffff73>That's right, we have some cards that I received from a friend.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Uhh... you're gonna need a few more cards than that.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Don't you have a practice deck we could try?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Yeah, we need a practice deck! Can't you just let us use one?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Tch, there's no such thing!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Okay, lemme think... To learn the game, you'll need at least two Character Cards to switch between...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Oh, oh! That reminds me, a few days ago when I was closing up for the night, I noticed a customer had left a couple of Character Cards on the bar counter. Haha! Maybe you could use those for now.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Are you sure that's okay...?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Eh, it's already been a few days and he still hasn't come back to claim them. Who knows, maybe he left them here on purpose...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Oh. Okay, yeah. Got them here with me, you know, just in case the customer came looking for them. Yeah, yeah, not because I like to play the game or anything. Please...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Alright, so now we have two Character Cards. That's everything we need, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Yup. So, are you ready to start?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: I'm ready!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Alright, then let's begin!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Not just yet, I need a moment...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Okay, I guess I'll get things set up on the table first. Once you're ready, we can get started.</color>\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Prince and Shuyun\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"You have not yet attained the status of official TCG players. First master the rules and hone your skills. Then, and only then, may you come and challenge me.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Yes, heed Prince's words. Besides, I need to keep mixing drinks for now. If you wait until I'm free, I can have Prince explain more for you...\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Sucrose\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> We should start learning how to play Genius Invokation TCG.\n<color=#ffffff73>Talk to Diona again</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Everything's set up. Let's learn how to play Genius Invokation TCG.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: I'm ready!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Alright, let's get started.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Not just yet, I need a moment...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Sure, just let me know once you're ready. Hmph, but don't keep me waiting too long!</color>\nAdditional Dialogue: The player left while the tutorial is ongoing.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Great, let's continue learning how to play Genius Invokation TCG.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: I'm ready!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Alright, let's get started.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Not just yet, I need a moment...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Sure, just let me know once you're ready. Hmph, but don't keep me waiting too long!</color>\nQuest Objective: Talk to Diona\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Alright, cool, those are the basics. Did you get all that?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> What we just played was an Adventure Challenge, designed specially for new players.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Genius Invokation TCG can be played in duel mode, where each player brings three Character Cards, or in Adventure Challenge mode, with a fixed deck for each challenge.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> But the rules are all the same. As long as you understand the basics, then you should be able to take on any of those rowdy boozehounds!\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Although I feel there are still many details to grasp, I think I understand the basic premise of the game now.\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> That was quite the detailed explanation. I didn't know The Cat's Tail's famous mixologist had such an eclectic skillset.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Waah! Wha— Oh! When did YOU get here...\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> I stepped in while you were in the middle of your explanation... I hope I didn't dampen the mood.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: No, not at all.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>You snuck in without making a sound...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Waah! Wha— Oh! When did YOU get here...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> <color=#ffffff73>You have slow reactions... Wait— are you copying me!? Shut up!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Ugh, anyway, what are you doing here?\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> The Cat's Tail is a player in Mondstadt's alcohol industry. Naturally, you have some collaboration with my winery.\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> I'm here today to discuss a few items of business with Margaret...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Too bad, she just left. But if you head off right now, you might still catch up with her!\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> Never mind, it's nothing urgent. In fact, I think I'm now more interested in this card that you're using to teach them the game.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Wait, this card...?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> It's Diluc's Character Card.\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> Although I have some degree of experience with Genius Invokation TCG, seeing this particular card is a first for me...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Uh, a customer left it behind a few days ago. But he wasn't even playing the game while he was here.\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> Oh? And what sort of a customer was he?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Uh... He wasn't wearing an eyepatch, okay? He had a light complexion, and a super serious look on his face. He wasn't much of a talker, and looked like he was just drinking his worries away. Eh... never seen him around here before!\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> Eyepatch, you say...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: That's Kaeya...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: There's no doubt about it...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Gah, I was trying to give the opposite description, but I just ended up giving it away. Sorry, Guard Captain...\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> Don't worry. Somehow, I don't think he'll be giving you any trouble over it...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> So... what about the Diluc Character Card...?\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> I don't mind. It's just a card with my image on it.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> I didn't expect Diluc to be familiar with Genius Invokation TCG!\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> The game has been catching on lately, it's hard to go anywhere without hearing it mentioned. Every now and then, I'll sit down and play a game with the customers in Angel's Share.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: You up for a game now?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: I challenge you to a duel!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> I was hoping we could play a game... But this issue of someone leaving a Character Card with my image at The Cat's Tail is... very intriguing.\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> It's getting late, and someone has some explaining to do... We'll have to have that duel another time.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Sure, I look forward to it!\n<color=#ffffff>Diluc:</color> Good. Then I'll take my leave.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> You know where the door is! Don't let the door hit ya where Lord Barbatos split ya!\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Uh-oh... Guard Captain...\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> I hope Kaeya will be alright...\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Well, now that we are familiar with the rules, why don't we try playing a game of Genius Invokation TCG?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Ooh, two new players having their first ever duel... haha! This sounds like fun!\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> But, in order to play an official duel, you need to have three Character Cards.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Remember, a complete deck has to have three Character Cards and thirty Action Cards. Got it?\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Then let's use my cards... These were mixed in with all the others I had received, and I didn't know what they were for at first. But now that we've learned the rules, I can see that this one must be the Sucrose Character Card.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Now, it looks like we each have the Kaeya, Diluc, and Sucrose Character Cards. So why don't we have our first duel?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: If you say so!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Alright, let's duel!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: ...Hold on, I need a moment. I'll be right back.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Take your time, I look forward to our first duel.</color>\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Diona\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Hehehe, let's see how you and Sucrose get along in your duel.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Now, I trained you myself, so you'd better not go down without a fight, okay! Huh, what? ...Well, yeah, I suppose I did train Sucrose, too... Hmm...\nTalk to Sucrose again\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Ready for our duel, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Let's play some Genius Invokation TCG!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Alright, let the duel begin!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Not just yet, I need a moment...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Sure. Even though it's just a game, it's important to be fully prepared. In that case, I think I'll go over the card stats again...\nQuest Objective: Have a Genius Invokation TCG duel with Sucrose\nQuest Objective: Talk to Sucrose\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> I can't believe I lost when we had the exact same Character Cards... The rules must be more complicated than I first thought.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Every decision is a difficult trade-off in this game. If there was only a way to transplant the arms of the two standby characters onto the active character's body—\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> That's not how the rules work, Sucrose. Don't be a sore loser. That kind of thing is looked down on in TCG circles.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Oh, I am sorry... I was beaten fair and square, I know that. I just can't stand losing.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> But it was a fun match.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: You went easy on me.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: It was a close call...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Paimon didn't know you could get so competitive, Sucrose.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> I always get a little upset when I lose.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> It's like that with my research, too. It always gets to me when my experiments don't go as planned, especially when there's an alchemy genius like Albedo around to compare myself to...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> ...Uhh, you lost me at \"alchemy\" and \"experiments.\" But I'm pretty sure it's normal to feel that way.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Playing cards is no different. Each game you lose makes you wanna win the next one to settle the score, and the desire to win pushes you to improve your strategy and build a better deck.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Hehe! Seizing victory through a winning combination of luck, skill, and experience is where all the fun of Genius Invokation lies!\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> ...But what if you keep trying and trying, and never win a single game?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> A losing streak... Yeah, that'll definitely get you down. But it's way better to keep trying until you win than to just accept you're a plain old loser and give up!\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Hmm... you make a good point, Diona.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Besides, Sucrose, you're already making great progress. It'd take at least eight of our regular boozehounds to match your level. You played well this last match!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Agreed. It was a brilliant game.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Thank you... I'm just a little disappointed to lose, that's all. But Genius Invokation TCG is a really fun game.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Good. Having fun is the main thing. If you ever wanna play again in the future, feel free to come by The Cat's Tail... Ah, but don't expect me to play with you, I just mean this place probably has the right atmosphere...\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> I'll definitely be back.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Alright, I think you should have the basics down by now. I need to get back to bartending — Shuyun's likely been busy making this tavern more popular with his delicious cocktails... Phooey, phooey, phooey! And we can't have that.\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Hmph! Burning Mondstadt's wine industry to the ground keeps me pretty busy, y'know! So if you need any more help, go bother Shuyun!\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Diona\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> I have to make drinks for the customers now...\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> If you've got any more questions about Genius Invokation TCG, you can go ask Shuyun. He's over there.\nQuest Objective: Talk to Shuyun\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> I see, so you have now grasped the rules of Genius Invokation TCG.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Hehehe, that's right! Traveler, Sucrose, and Paimon are TCG players now!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> I didn't notice you play any matches, Paimon...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Uh... Paimon picked it up from watching you and Sucrose!\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"Becoming a TCG player is not as simple as that. You cannot call yourselves true TCG players until you have passed the test.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Sobering words from Prince there... But I'm afraid he's right. To become official players recognized by the Genius Invokation TCG Society, you have to pass the test.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: There's really a test?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Yes, although to be honest, it's not that difficult...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: What does it entail? Sealing a Samachurl within a deck of cards?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> <color=#ffffff73>It's just a tabletop card game. I'm not sure how you would plan on achieving something like that...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Basically, to become an official and recognized TCG player, you have to best three opponents in a duel.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> So you have to win three duels against three different opponents?\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"The duel you just played can count towards this tally...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> I agree. Although I didn't get to observe the match myself, I did listen along. And from what I could hear, you both performed at a rather high level.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Same way you can \"hear\" what Prince says...?\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> A well-trained ear is a basic skill expected of anyone hoping to become a TCG master. But back to the matter at hand — Traveler only needs to beat two more opponents to become an official TCG player.\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Sucrose, you may have lost the last duel, but don't be disheartened. I can assure you that winning three games is well within your ability.\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"But first things first, Shuyun. Before that, our TCG newcomers should receive their free gift...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Ah yes, my goodness. Completely slipped my mind — I'm lucky to have Prince here to remind me. Everyone who wants to start playing Genius Invokation TCG is entitled to claim a free Casket of Tomes.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: A Casket of Tomes?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Where have I heard that before?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Oh, Timaeus mentioned it, didn't he? It was from the light novels he's been reading. The thing that the main character found in his attic...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Ohh, that's right. The soul of an ancient TCG player was trapped inside, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> So the Casket of Tomes is actually real?\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Heh, well... actually, all card cases in Genius Invokation TCG are called Caskets of Tomes. Not only do they provide a reliable and sturdy container to store your decks, they can also sense when other people in the area are also carrying a Casket of Tomes with them—\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Ooh, Paimon can guess what you're gonna say next — the reason they can sense each other is because they have the souls of ancient TCG players inside!\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> That would mean an extraordinarily high number of people in history have been turned into disembodied souls as a consequence of playing card games... No, the real reason that it can sense other Caskets is because it holds a nifty little mechanism invented by Sumeru scholars...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Darn, what a letdown...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Sounds like a convenient way of finding other TCG players.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Cool! A TCG friend finder!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Alright, now let's see this Casket of Tomes already!\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> \"Meow! All Caskets of Tomes are issued by Margaret, so you will need to see her to claim yours...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Probably for the best. If Prince and I were responsible for handing them out, knowing how eager we both are to promote the game, we'd probably have dished them all out by now...\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Okay, so go and see Margaret to claim your Casket of Tomes, use it to find another player, beat them in a duel, and then come back here.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> But even for Traveler, that's only two wins in total. What about the last one?\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"I shall choose the final contestant she/he must beat in order to become an official TCG player, for it must be one of comparable prowess.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Excellent plan, Prince! Happy dueling, both of you.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Diona\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Ugh, let me guess — you're here to order a drink, hmph... Oh, it's you. So, how are your Genius Invokation matches going?\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> You need to win three matches to become an official TCG player? Ohh yeah, now you mention it, I remember there being some sort of rule about that. Why'd they have to make it so competitive? It's just a game, why can't people just have fun!\n<color=#ffffff>Diona:</color> Hmph, I'll never understand why grown-ups have to put a bunch of stupid rules on everything.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Prince and Shuyun\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"Go, claim your Casket of Tomes, seize victory, and become a TCG champion!\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Prince seems to have high hopes for you.\nQuest Objective: Go to Margaret and Claim the Casket of Tomes\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Hello you three, has Little Diona finished teaching you the rules of Genius Invokation?\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> Ah, I see, you're here for your Casket of Tomes, aren't you? A very useful tool indeed.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> So this is a Casket of Tomes.\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> That's right. A purpose-built case for your card deck, that can even detect when someone else nearby is carrying one... Gosh, whoever invented this must have seriously disliked being alone.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Yeah. Well, even the most fun game is pretty lonely if you've got no one else to play it with.\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> True. So I'm glad that these customers... ahem, TCG players are able to congregate at The Cat's Tail.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Can't be bad for business...\n<color=#ffffff>Margaret:</color> You're not wrong, but that's secondary. The important thing to me is the opportunity for like-minded people to come together and enjoy their favorite hobby. It creates a nice atmosphere... Anyway, now you have your Caskets of Tomes, it's time to find some opponents.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Alright. In that case, I'll go find some people to play against, too. Let's meet back at The Cat's Tail in a while!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Trust in your cards.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: You can win this.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Thanks. I'll do my best.\nObtain"

Now we have two victories under our belt.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Let's get back to The Cat's Tail. Paimon wonders, who's Prince gonna pick as our final contestant?\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"I sensed that Traveler had what it took to become an official TCG player, but she/he has returned to the tavern more quickly than I had expected.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"Defeat the opponent I have arranged for you, and you shall become an official TCG player. I look forward to watching this game immensely.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Not just Prince. I can't wait either. Come, your opponent is waiting for you in one of the private rooms.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> She/He won't lose to them, whoever it is! Right, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Naturally.\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color> What ho, fellow voyager of the stellar void. Yes, even I was briefly discountenanced when I heard the tidings of your sworn oath to become the Thrice Victorious... But so be it! You who are enslaved by dueling desire, be released from your shackles into the glorious arena of gladiatorial combat!\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color> Step forth, O brave challenger, your Prinzessin grants you an audience. Hmph, hearken well! The wretched clock chimes yet again, as the declining light of the day grows dimmer still...\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color> Pardon my directness, but we have not been waiting that long. Mein Fräulein could afford to be a little less impatient.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Huh, Paimon knows those voices...\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"Your opponent sounds anxious to begin. Do not delay!\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> That's what Prince said... Please enter, and enjoy your Genius Invokation TCG duel!\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Prince and Shuyun\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Meow... \"Traveler shows greater skill than most beginners, but Fischl displays greater prowess still...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Shuyun:</color> Oh, you really think so? I think Traveler has the edge, personally...\nQuest Objective: Go to the duel room\nQuest Objective: Have a Genius Invokation TCG duel with Fischl\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Paimon knew it, it's Fischl and Oz!\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Who else but the Prinzessin? For as the name of this hallowed rite suggests, only when the wisest of heroes is summoned can the master of cards hope to be crowned the champion.\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> This path is a treacherous one... It must be tread with great caution, for eternal doom and damnation are but one wrong step away at any given moment.\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> That is why none is more suited to appear in this audience chamber than the Prinzessin, whose Auge der Verurteilung des Großen Kaleidophantasmas has witnessed ten thousand battles across three thousand worlds.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Oh, is that right...\n<color=#ffffff>Oz:</color> Indeed, mein Fräulein has watched many games of Genius Invokation TCG, and has gained a solid grasp of the rules. Even in a duel between beginners, it is best that both participants are well-versed in them.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Oh, that's true.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: A duel between beginners?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: When you say \"watched\" many games...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Ahh, this makes sense now. Prince did say that he was gonna pair us with someone of a similar skill level... Guess that means Fischl hasn't been playing that long either!\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Hmph, the Prinzessin needed but a single glance at these mere machinations of mankind to discern their working principles. Thus, with speed and brilliance paralleled by lightning alone do I now arrive here at the gateway to yonder circle of secrets...\n<color=#ffffff>Oz:</color> Mein Fräulein, too, has bested two opponents thus far, and is therefore one step away from becoming an official TCG player.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> So there's a lot on the line, huh? Either Fischl or Traveler is gonna come out of this duel as an official TCG player...\n<color=#ffffff>Oz:</color> Indeed.\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Hmph! The Prinzessin herself heeds the call of fate and descends to this realm from the Immernachtreich, yet still you dare to doubt the inevitability of the inevitable. Your stubborn foolishness is contemptible.\n<color=#ffffff>Oz:</color> Mein Fräulein, I implore you to consider less odious turns of phrase, lest you be forced to feast on your words in the fullness of time.\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Wh— ...I shall not lose, Oz!\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> What say you, outlander? Do you wish to make an enemy of me, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, who even now begins to strum the strings of fate that shall sound out the Traveler's Requiem?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Verily, 'tis time to duel!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Then I say it is time to see what you are made of!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Wait, wait, wait, I need to check my deck first...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Oh, do you? How disappointing. But then again, for one accustomed to the petty burdens of this lowly realm, to challenge the Prinzessin is a load under which most mere mortals would crumble.</color>\nTalk to Fischl again\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> I ask you once again, outlander: Do you wish to make an enemy of me?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Verily, 'tis time to duel!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Then it is time to see what you are made of!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Not yet... I entreat Your Majesty to ask me again later...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Very well, I will ask you again when the time comes. But be warned, should you seek to flee when the hour of the battle draws nigh... I shall show you no mercy.\nQuest Objective: Talk to Fischl\nScenario: The player won the challenge.\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Impossible... Ugh, the cursed dragon looms near once more, casting its dark shadow on the slender threads of fate, hiding them from my vision...\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Traveler... Was even this part of your plan?\n<color=#ffffff>Oz:</color> What a truly ingenious plot, and what an exciting duel to witness.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Congratulations! You've won three duels now. That makes you an official TCG player!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Yeah! ...Oh, Sucrose, you're back. Does that mean...\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Yep, I've won two games so far. When I got back, I heard you were in the middle of your final duel, so I came over to watch.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Nice, Sucrose won two as well. Great work!\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Hmph. It seems I am forced to admit, fellow voyager of the stellar void, that your... mastery of the cards is second to none.\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> To commemorate your glorious ascent to a battlefield beyond this lowly mortal realm, I grant thee an incarnation of my majesty in miniature. As you embark on this ingenious vocation, may you wield it in battle against all your fated foes, that not a single one of them may be left standing.\n<color=#ffffff>Oz:</color> Mein Fräulein wishes to give you a Mein Fräulein Character Card.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Wow, it's Fischl's Character Card!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> I dare not take advantage of the Prinzessin's generosity...\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> 'Tis a mere token of such. To the victor of this splendid duel is a boon of commensurate splendor due.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> Oh, um, excuse me Ma'am, I am also a beginner who has won two games so far. Might I also have the honor of joining you in a duel? If you would be willing, of course.\n<color=#ffffff>Fischl:</color> Nothing would delight me more. I hereby grant you permission to join me in performing the hallowed rite of Genius Invokation.\n<color=#ffffff>Sucrose:</color> One other thing. When I got back, Prince and Shuyun said there was something they needed to give you if you managed to become an official TCG player.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Hopefully not another test...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Probably not... Oh, Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Hopefully an instant victory card?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> <color=#ffffff73>No card game in the world has a card like that. Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Let's go get our prize!\nObtain"
