Rhodeia, who was the most renowned and strongest of Lochfolk scouts, desired only to keep the dreams of yesteryear alive. She wanted a small haven of tranquil waters, so she settled in Qingce Village. Rhodeia has tremendous wisdom and compassion and can create Oceanid creatures. It is believed that she’s so powerful that she is able to mimic a human.\nWhen Rhodeia first sensed the presence of another Oceanid Endora, she believed Endora to be an assassin from Fontaine, and so she stretched forth her enmity, which turned the water bitter, in order to slay the little Oceanid. Rhodeia sent her scouts, water animals, to observe Endora, and the latter was able to join with them to learn about Rhodeia's plans. When Endora finally explained that she meant no harm, Rhodeia made the water sweet again and asked Endora to join together with the waters of Qingce.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
