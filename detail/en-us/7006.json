There's treasure in the cave, but this fella here has totally blocked off the entrance, and won't move at all...\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\nArrooo?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah? What's wrong?\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\nArrooo...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nBah, Paimon didn't understand that at all! Little One, can you tell what this Yumkasaur is trying to say?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nEhrrr?\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\n?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nLooks like that didn't work... *sigh* And even if they could understand each other, it's not like we could talk with Little One either.\nIf only we had a way to understand what was being said, then maybe we could give it what it wants and make it move out of the way.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> You discover a Yumkasaurus standing in the way of some treasure. Can you find a way to make it leave...?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Find a way to communicate with the Yumkasaurus</color>\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Strange Yumkasaurus\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\nArrooo?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, is there something you want? ...If only we had a way to know what that is...\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\nWant to eat...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nYou want to eat?\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\nFlat stomach, stomach, so hot...\nWant to eat—\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat were you mumbling about just now?\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\n* grumble*\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, could it be you're really hungry?\nA Saurian here all by itself, and no master in sight... It probably isn't even able to find its own food...\nC'mon, Traveler, let's go help find it some food!\nOnce it gets full and moves out of the way, the treasure will be all ours! Hehe...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nWhat should we feed it, though?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nLet Paimon think for a sec! Saurians here tend to eat a bit of everything, and Paimon isn't sure what Yumkasaurs eat... Looking at its color, it feels kinda like it should eat leaves and grass and that kinda thing...\nLet's find one of those and give it a try first! Hungry bellies tend not to be too picky!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Feed the Yumkasaurus</color>\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Strange Yumkasaurus again\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumksasaurus:</color>\nRemember now... *gurgle* Want to eat... Meaty food...\nThe alternative dialgue appears if player submits a non-meat food item\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? Do you not like it...? It won't touch it...\nHey now, beggars aren't supposed to be this choosy... Hmm, just what kind of food might it like?\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\nArroo arroo... *stomach rumbling*\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah! Hehe, sure looks good. It'll definitely like it!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to the Yumkasaurus</color>\n<color=#ffffff>The Yumkasaur downs the food in front of it in a flash.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>You almost don't even manage to see just how the feat was accomplished...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nL—Look at the food... It's vanishing!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Paimon, you've got competition.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, what're you trying to say? Paimon's a true gourmet, she's very particular about food, and would never just chow down like that... How can you truly enjoy your food if you just vacuum it up?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Just one serving... doesn't seem to be enough.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nY—Yeah! Paimon couldn't tell, but this little guy's a real \"Megasnackasaurus\"... It's a good thing Little One can't eat that much...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nStill, maybe the poor thing was just starving! Poor fella, let's give it another serving.\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nArawrrr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nDoes Little One also want to eat? Let's feed this other Sauropal first, and then we'll fix you up something delicious!\n<color=#ffffff>The hungry Saurian eats everything you lay out in a single gulp.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>You blink, as though the scene seemed to unfold twice...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOkay, that should at least fill your tummy—\nHey! Wait a sec, how are you sitting down again? Is two servings not enough!?\nWhoa, and just going to sleep right in front of the cave after eating? Doesn't seem remotely interested in getting out of the way, either!\nWhat should we do, Traveler? Paimon doesn't get this guy... Even if you wanna take a nap after eating, at least don't block the way!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I don't think it ever agreed to get out of the way, though.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Definitely feels like we've been had.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nGrraaaah! And it ate so much of our food too...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEven Little One can't stand to watch! C'mon, Traveler, we've gotta try and wake it up!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Try talking to the Yumkasaurus</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\n* snoring* *snoring*\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWow, this Saurian's sleeping unreasonably soundly... Guess it's a layabout on top of being a greedy-guts.\n<color=#ffffff>Strange Yumkasaurus:</color>\n* snoring*... He's right. Just need block cave... *snoring*... Then can eat meaty food...\n(The Yumkasaur falls into a deep sleep. It doesn't seem like you'll be able to wake it up.)\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEhh, it won't wake up? Ugh, so annoying! D'you think it's just pretending to be asleep?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nEhrrr?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It does seem to actually be asleep...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>And sleeptalking, though...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nEhrrr?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n(You relate the contents of the sleep-talk...)\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAre you saying it's intentionally blocking the way just to get food, cheating people out of their grub... Ugh. We fell for it hook, line, and sinker...\nHmph! But if that's how things are, then we don't have to play nice!\nLet's just have Little One tunnel over and get to that chest!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIf it's gonna take the low road, we can't be expected to play fair either!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Get your Saurian companion to take away the treasure chest</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to Paimon</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, well done! Now let's see what goodies are hiding in the chest!\nAh? There's nothing at all? Just a note?\nOh, so the one who left the note was its actual master? So we weren't tricked by the Saurian, but by its master?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Totally irresponsible.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah! Even if he was really sick, how could he just leave his Yumkasaur in a place like this!?\nAnd he even wanted to use people's greed to... No, wait, he wanted to take advantage of people's empathy for the Saurian...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>So, those who eat too much are destined to be abandoned by their friends...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey! Don't even joke about things like that! Besides, the Saurian is innocent in all this, maybe it's just waiting here for its master to return, which is why it refuses to move...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n* sigh* Anyway, it's not like we can just let it stay here tricking people out of their food. Let's go find the Chief of the Scions of the Canopy and tell him about this.\n<color=#ffffff>You explain the situation to Wayna, chief of the Scions of the Canopy, and bring him over.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wayna:</color>\nOh dear, I had a hunch about this when you came looking for me...\nWho'd have thought it was that scoundrel that left behind this creature...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nThat scoundrel?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRrrawr?\n<color=#ffffff>Wayna:</color>\nHe was one who did wrong, then in fear of punishment, left the tribe of his own accord.\nBut I see no good in divulging the offender's name. Perhaps he himself was well aware that what he did was no good thing. See — he didn't even leave his name at the end of this letter.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSo his Saurian chose to join him...\n<color=#ffffff>Wayna:</color>\nNo, we cannot say that it \"chose\" to do so. Saurians are simple creatures that cannot easily distinguish right from wrong. Most of the time, they simply follow their emotions and trust their companions.\n...As I suspected, at the core, he hasn't changed. Whatever small wits he has he employs towards devising tricks to deceive others, even his own Saurian.\nWe will send people to feed this Yumkasaurus on a regular basis. It is a child of the tribe, after all...\nAs for that scoundrel... *sigh* It is a tragic ending indeed, but I refuse to sympathize with him. People should be held responsible for their actions."
