To give the injured civilians a safe escape and to maintain their honor in the eyes of Rex Lapis, the Milleliths bravely fought the monsters in the Chasm, when suddenly, the four-armed Yaksha appeared on the battlefield. Having gone mad, at the decisive moment, he distracted the monsters towards himself. Together with him, the Milleliths moved deeper into the Chasm. In the course of fighting side-by-side with the Yaksha, these mortal soldiers could not escape being contaminated by karma or harmed during the slaughtering. To avoid being consumed by the darkness of constant killing, the Millelith soldiers used the timepiece to silently mark the passage of time during each battle. They fixed a unified marching pace and schedule so that one squadron of mortal soldiers would take the battlefield as the one before they retreated. This cycle of advance and retreat continued all the way to the depths of the Chasm, where yaksha and valiant soldiers both fell."
