It was originally brief, as the only matters too sacred to be spoken of at length were the chief god who protected our ancestors, and the origin, past, and future of the moons. The first Moonchanter, Aila, later revised and simplified the prayer's content. The following text is now recognized as the standard for all recitations:\nO pale white Frost Moon, in the name of the descendants of the far north, I beseech you to cast down your gaze from the celestial dome above.\nMay your gentle tears pierce the frigid night, and grant us, the forsaken and forgotten, your guiding light.)\nPrayer Song XXII: Kuutar, the Moon Maiden\nO pure and flawless new moon, in the name of the messenger of the Frost Moon, I beg for your grace and mercy.\nCleanse us of our sins, I pray, and wipe away the endless pains and tears of those forever barred from Elysium."
