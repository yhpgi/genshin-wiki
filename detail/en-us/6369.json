If the scales tipped to one side, they could leave.\nBut the scales were so rusty that putting just a small amount of weight was not enough to move them.\nThose boars who placed their heads on the scales became wolves, lizards, and snakes, leaving only their strength. Those who offered their muscles became rabbits, leaping three paces to a bound, instinctively guiding people to treasure.\nBut there was one boar who placed things evenly on both sides, until the rusted scale broke right down the middle...\nAnd so she became a mute person — for she had placed her voice upon the scales as well.\nShe is also a friend of Madame Mage, and I hear she likes to speak in people's heads!"

She advised me to speak more steadily and present an air of mystery and nobility — which is how I wound up speaking the way you remember.\nI'm off, in any case.
