That is the case, though I have spoken directly into peoples' minds for so long... that I never practiced my penmanship anyway.\nNo need to worry if I've pried into any of your innermost thoughts, I've never done anything like that. If that does not reassure you, let me share one of my secrets with you. Having been suffocated by my inability to speak, I wound up being an incredibly talkative person at first. Alice noted that those who used their real mouths to blather on with had far fewer problems than I, since I would set my head abuzz and give myself quite a headache whenever I spoke. She advised me to speak more steadily and present an air of mystery and nobility — which is how I wound up speaking the way you remember.\nI'm off, in any case. There's not much to worry about here with you — so why don't you watch over me instead?"

If the scales tipped to one side, they could leave.\nBut the scales were so rusty that putting just a small amount of weight was not enough to move them.\nThose boars who placed their heads on the scales became wolves, lizards, and snakes, leaving only their strength. Those who offered their muscles became rabbits, leaping three paces to a bound, instinctively guiding people to treasure.\nBut there was one boar who placed things evenly on both sides, until the rusted scale broke right down the middle...\nAnd so she became a mute person — for she had placed her voice upon the scales as well.\nShe is also a friend of Madame Mage, and I hear she likes to speak in people's heads!"
