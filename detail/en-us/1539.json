He looked and had eyes like a wolf,\" he added.\n\"I had just mastered my magic, and was running around excitedly on my hind legs. Running on grass was fun! But sadly, due to the difference in height, a fox can't see or smell the same things that a human can.\"\n\"I'm sure you can guess what happened next, teacher! Suddenly, I realized a horrible truth — I was lost.\"\nThere was pain in his voice as he relayed the events of that day.\nIn the end, he had wandered into some faraway wood, and encountered vicious monsters.\nJust when he thought he was done for, the gray lupine boy suddenly leapt out of the forest and chased away the monsters. Without a word, he then turned around and vanished into the woods.\n\"If I could transform into a human and speak their language, I could track him down and make friends with him!\"\nHe said gleefully.\nI couldn't help but ask when I heard his reply:\n\"Am I not your friend?\"\nThe little one answered sincerely in the common tongue:\n\"Mommy told me that it's different because you're my teacher — but I'd only hurt you if I tell you that.\"\nHe tilted his head in befuddlement. His fluffy tail patted the surrounding dandelions as he pondered over this difficult issue.\n\"I know!\"\nHe burst out.\n\"If I know something that you don't, that would make me your teacher.\"\n\"If we are both teachers, that would make us equals — then we can be friends!\"\nStill unfamiliar with the common tongue, he did his best to get the sentence out quickly.\n\"Teacher, please allow me to teach you some magic that only I know.\""
