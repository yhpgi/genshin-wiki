What they saw was what they sung, and what they heard was what they played.\nAs time passed, the troupe gradually realized the vastness of the world.\n\"There are so many things in the world for us to sing of.\"\nThe members then turned the notes into words and recorded their journey in a book.\nThis book, The Widsith as they called it, was still held tightly in the conductor's hands even after his death."

They performed not only for friends, but also for foes.\nThey traveled through the desert and set foot in the blazing Mare Jivari.\nThe tune of the harp echoing in the kettle was a reminder for them.\n\"Along with the boundless tunes we walk.\"\n\"Wherever there is music, there is us.\""
