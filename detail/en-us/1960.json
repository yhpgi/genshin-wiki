A product of premium materials and masterful artisanship.\nFor that reason, it remains sharp as it was on the day it was first forge, even many generations after the nobles' time ended.\nBut back in the era of the nobility, this weapon never saw the light of day, and bathed only in the pale moonlight.\nThe nobles believed that those of high blood should use swords in battle.\nTo them, the sound of blades clashing was the chorus the lofty souls.\nThe spear and the bow, on the other hand, were the weapons of plebeian gladiators and commoners.\nCommoners with pitchforks and sharpened wooden poles, after all, could yet be a match for sword-wielding scions of nobility.\nThis was, undoubtedly, a hard pill for the rulers of Old Mondstadt to swallow.\nLegend has it that there was also a youth of noble stock,\nWho sought out a smith to make this weapon, emblazoned with their house's crest,\nAnd yet which, like this youth, could never earn the favor of his family...\nNo, not without the spilling of blood.\nIf that youth wanted change to come, they needed power.\nEven if it meant using a weapon seen as ignoble.\nEven if it meant that their spear-wielding shadow could never see any light but that of the deep night's moon."
