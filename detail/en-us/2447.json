When they grew up, they joined the Tenryou Commission and the Shogunate army to fight the Watatsumi Resistance. They both believed that the people of Sangonomiya had chosen the path of death by drawing the sword against the Shogun. The friends wanted to make a name for themselves to take care of their parents. Although Kenji Kazumichi and Masanori were of lowly origins and were often bullied by members of wealthy families, they earned the title of Hatamoto for their outstanding service.\nDuring one battle, Masanori killed a resistance soldier and found a bloody, unsent letter home on him. Upon reading the letter, the samurai realized that the soldier had once looked after him when he first joined the army. In that letter, the rebel wrote that he missed the fishing boat back home and that he looked forward to returning after the war was over. At that moment, Masanori realized that the rebels were also people who had parents to take care of and a home to return to. Sympathy began to grow within him, and he wanted to send a letter to the family of the dead soldier, but the people in the army found out about it, became hostile towards him, and wanted to put him in danger on the battlefield. After that, Masanori decided to leave the Shogunate army and join the Resistance. He hoped that by the time his friend, Kenji Kazumichi, read the letter, the war would already be over and they would be able to return home as they had dreamed of before.\nKenji Kazumichi could not accept his friend's decision, and in one of the battles against the Watatsumi army, he may have killed Masanori. The shock of his friend's death was so great that Kenji Kazumichi went mad with grief, and his memories of even his own name were erased. The samurai left the shogun's army, becoming a kairagi known as the “Nameless.”\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "Before meeting the Traveler, Nameless won every duel against the other warriors who passed by, trying to remember who he was and why he was there. His only companion was his sword, Takatsuki Dougire. Nameless heard it complaining about the lack of battles and becoming inspired at the sight of opponents.\nWhen the Traveler became the first to defeat Nameless, they offered to help restore the kairagi's memories. The Traveler found an old sword in the fishing village where Nameless was born. The blade awakened memories of two children (himself and his friend Masanori) who wanted two identical swords in the kairagi. Everyone laughed at them for not being able to afford quality blades, but the children were happy with the failed swords that the blacksmith threw away. The Traveler then went to the Kujou Encampment, where they met Matsudaira, an old friend of Nameless, who gave them a jug of wine that was once drunk in the army. After tasting the wine, Nameless remembered the name \"Masanori\" and decided that it might be his name. He also remembered that he had a friend with whom he was like brothers and always spent time together, but then they had a fight.\nAfter another duel with the Traveler, \"Masanori\" remembered how someone's sword fell from their hands, and when he saw that sword, he got scared and ran away, ending up in Tatarasuna. The last item that the Traveler took to the kairagi was the sword that belonged to the real Masanori. The kairagi remembered his friend and became angry that he had left, although he had promised that they would return home together. The more \"Masanori\" remembered, the more anger and pain he felt that rose from the depths of his soul. His past was not like a beautiful fairy tale, and he decided to give up trying to get all his memories back. He chose to remain in Tatarasuna, watching the sea and listening to the wind, waiting for the next duel with the Traveler.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
