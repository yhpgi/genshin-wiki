Its body was like that of a mountain, and it devoured the tribespeople of Tenochtzitoc.\nAn out-of-control creation identified as one of \"Gold\"'s that once attacked and swallowed part of her body. Lacking in intelligence, its actions are solely devoted to an instinct to devour. It is capable of infinite growth and is functionally immortal.\nHowever, unlike \"Gold\"'s other creations, its immortality does not stem from the power of \"Life,\" but rather a more transcendent form of Abyssal power that may be beyond even our Order's understanding."
