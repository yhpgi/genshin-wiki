She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.\nNoelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.\nHowever, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter.\n\"No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be.\"\nNoelle doesn't think herself special, only that she thinks too much at times."

Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.\nOf course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...\nFor example, a merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.\nHe disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.\nInitially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.\nNoelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.\nThis spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?\nIn the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.\nNoelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously."

It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.\nHowever, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.\nAt the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.\nThe adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.\nIt was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.\nIn order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.\nDuring the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few \"urgent matters\" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over."

Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.\nThere was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.\nRumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion.\nIn all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.\nAt first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.\nPutting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.\nBut don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.\nThey say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...\nLet's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky."

During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.\nIt's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.\nThe crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.\nThe smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.\nFor the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.\nThe festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning."

These things are all top secret.\nTo avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses — in Mondstadt, this flower means \"my lips are sealed.\"\nShe specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.\nRevealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.\nSo you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets. She won't tell."

Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.\nThe etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?\nShe had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.\nAt that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.\nWithout a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.\nImmediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.\nBut just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.\nAfter a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.\nThis was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.\nHer hard work had been remembered after all.\nFrom that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable — and yes, everywhere at once too."
