  "desc": "A talisman that somehow appeared in your inventory after you passed the Wayward Hermetic Spiritspeaker's test.<br>In some records kept by the Masters of the Night-Wind, priests masterful in Spiritspeaking can use meditation to pass their consciousness through the light and shadow that reflects off obsidian, thus reaching the enigmatic underground realm that only the dead may enter. This deed is, however, perilous, and priests who perform it must often wear such talismans to guard their souls from being lost in that mysterious land. However, this talisman's symbolic value far outstrips its real effects. Perhaps the hermit-priest who grants this to a warrior who passes the test only does so as a simple blessing.",

It is said that her Spiritspeaking powers surpass those of ordinary priests and shamans, a result of having had the protection of the Masters of the Night-Wind's Wayob bestowed upon her. Both a blessing and a curse, these powers were at first beyond her ability to control, which was why she set out to master them in isolation from her tribe. Though she has since done so, to this day she still lives in seclusion, a habit that has earned her a reputation as a loner and a recluse. Rumor has it, however, that she is more than willing to teach those who seek her guidance — though always on her own terms...",
