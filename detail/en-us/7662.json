It is said that this strategy minimized physical strain on the wielder, enabling Walter to strike down hordes of pursuing villains and fiends with ruthless efficiency.<br>This quality was only further exaggerated in fantastical filmic retellings, birthing the trope of \"Mechanically Enhanced Warriors.\"<br>Meanwhile, this Composite Hunter's Bow — designed to push the limits of long-range stealth shooting — demands repeated calibration and fine-tuning to achieve peak performance.",
