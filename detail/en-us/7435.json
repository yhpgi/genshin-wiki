At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.<br/>This is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changed over many years to \"Torachiyo.\"<br/>But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.<br/>Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional.",

May the years ahead be filled with many a night as happy as this.\"\nThus sighed Hakushin, chief amongst kitsune, perched high up on the seat of honor, surrounded by an entourage of her kin.\n\"Time, oh time, if only we could stop it here,\" she mused, and as she did so, raised her sake cup,\nConferring the title of \"Tamayuratei\" upon the lowly, unknown youkai on the stage.\nBut life seldom goes as we wish it, just as prayers born of anguish are frequently left unanswered.\nThe fleeting melancholy that came upon the Hakushin chief proved prophetic; for as we all know, the day came when a dark, corrosive tide engulfed the land.\nGone were those nights when a hundred youkai larked with such abandon — only weeping and wailing could be heard by the lamplight.\nAmid a battlefield of such cruel devastation, was there still a place for one who had once inspired joy through playful banter?\nYet remembering the great one to whom it owed its name, despite its frailty, the little youkai felt compelled to act.\nIn those days when shadows blotted out the sky, its very soul was ablaze as it roamed the land, darting from fire to fire.\nIts eloquence, once employed in the telling of frivolous tales, it now devoted to the precise relaying of battle reports and accounts of enemy movements.\nYet, as time went on, such ceaseless exertions took an irreparable toll.\nDividing its essence again and again, the youkai nearly expended its entire spirit.\nNo longer could it utter such clever words from within its lantern,\nAnd even its most cherished memories were scattered.\nToday, it is said that the bewildered youkai has forgotten all,\nOnly appearing on the most lively of occasions, when large crowds gather to hear the most fantastic of tales.\nPerhaps it is stirred by the atmosphere such storytellers create,\nAllowing it to recall, if but momentarily, a past it can never reclaim."
