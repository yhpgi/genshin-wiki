How could the crude arts of ordinary mortals forge such a beautiful gem?\"\n\"Our Master has given me and my foolish brother orders to come and offer you a secret salve with which to heal your wounds.\"\n\"The gem that our Master bestowed upon us is here.

Nanatzcayan will see you as enemies who betrayed our Alliance.\"\n\"O Brother, my foolish brother... What you seek has long ceased to be vengeance, but a blind bloodlust, merely to satiate yourself.\"\nThe increasingly incendiary language and the sneering moonlight stole the last trace of his rationality, and brought about a burning rage,\nThe hero who once locked horns with the titanic dragon drew the blade at his waist and leveled it at the neck of his closest kin.\nHe intended to do no more than cow the opposition, so as to make that calm Chief of the mines of the mountains obey the new King's decree,\nBut the crimson that spurted forth terminated all talk, leaving only despairing wails.\nAt the end of the path of \"strength\" and \"blessings,\" the hero held the one closest to him in his embrace and walked into the incinerating fire.\nIn the end, the beacons of war between the tribes were not lit, but rather, were extinguished along with the disappearance of the two Chiefs.\nPretending to forgive the dragons, the King sent emissaries to attempt to persuade those of the canyons and Plenty to temporarily hand authority over to the Alliance,\nUntil such time as the two tribes had each chosen new Chiefs, and the banners that signified their glory would be returned to them;\nWhile secretly recording the names of those who had sheltered the dragons, waiting for a chance to take the traitors' heads.\nBut Sakkuk, who was later proclaimed the agent of the tribe, was at that time yet aware of the course fate had charted for her...\nEven the scheming usurper could not have known that the obstacles to seizing authority would be swept aside so easily.\nAnd just as he was wailing and rejoicing, the young heir of the Flower-Feather Clan offered him yet more secret counsel..."
