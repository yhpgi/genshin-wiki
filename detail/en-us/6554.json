Past slaves shall be future masters.\"\n\"Our race is mired in spiraling contradiction inexorable. Only in sowing seeds shall we find salvation.\"\n\"Perhaps, out there in the abundant primordial wilderness, there is a land that has yet to know the touch of filth and decay.\"\nThus, passing through searing flame and raging wind, it took as-yet unextinguished primordial kindling from the ancient palace beneath the magma.\nBearing the hopes of another race, the wisest of dragons bid farewell to the splendorous city ineffable."

It would civilize these barbarians, but it would also order their destinies.\nFor unlike the plan of that first divine one, what the most sage one brought was the profane path of \"evolution,\"\nIts far sight had divined that at the end of that path, human blood would be poured into the derelict body of the moribund earth,\nMerging two species and two bloodlines as one, and thus would an ancient pulse surge through a reborn civilization.\nIndeed, it would be as the wisest one said unto the first barbarian who climbed upon the floating landmass to visit it:\n\"But from your heirs shall come the savior of two worlds. He shall be brutal as a manticore, but as cunning as a wild fox.\"\n\"One day, he shall slay the overlord of fire and ascend to the oldest of thrones. Praise be unto the ruler of two worlds!\""

His tribe had scattered, and none now sang of his saga.\nOnly in the deepest nights could he hear that call from a faraway realm, as if to reignite the fading flame in his heart.\nOn the last night of his life, he climbed a high mountain to ignite the first flame. He called out, hoping to reunite with his former companions.\nAnd the gods of the night realm responded. That night, people throughout the land seemed to hear voices from another world,\nLike a mother's clear song, like the low whispers of old friends — the birth-cry of the first Wayob of the Night Kingdom."

Indeed, they still hid in the night's deepest depths, waiting to strike a final blow.\nFor it knew that neither the gods in their heavens nor the high king among dragons would suffice — all knowledge and strength had to be gathered before that day came.\nOnly by this could his stubborn kin awaken from the ancient, shattered dreams of a decrepit king.\nOnly by this could the ancient civilization welcome suitable successors and find its footing once more on the earth."
