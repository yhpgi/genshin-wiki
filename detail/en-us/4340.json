Hmm, I am really not a fan of naming things. Oh, I've got just the word.\"\n\"In honor of the credit you've given me to run this experiment, I will call it the Credit Coupon.\"\nThe overseer made of precision machinery rumbles as it observes the monetary flow of the tiny nation,\nTirelessly recording the movement of every amount of money, the savings and spending of all,\nThe changes in value, and the number of times each piece of currency is circulated over a specific period.\nThe only law present is the private law of the hoarder, and the only sanctions are poverty or death.\nEither to become a rentier and gain power and control, or to be subjected to control and work to death. The rules are always fair.\nThus, humanity will stand on equal ground with the Gods by virtue of their inherent ambitions and wealth,\nAnd the weak who failed to prevail shall be swallowed by the flood that is the mortal world.\nThe power of the Gods shall no longer intervene to embellish the power of the wealthy before the poor,\nNor shall the wealth of the Gods descend, to rescue the dignity of the poor from the feet of the rich."
