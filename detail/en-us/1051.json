They are born of water's essence, faceless descendants of the angels.\nThus, when the curious fairy emerged from the water and heard the cry of that boy's heart, she became interested in this life, younger and more fragile than her own.\nThe silent fairy reached out her formless fingers, cold as the midnight dew and soft as fortune forgone, and gently caressed the boy's forehead and cheeks.\nStartled by this stranger's touch, the young boy lifted his head and met the fairy's gaze.\n\"Can you make my wish come true?\" The boy asked.\nThe fairy of the spring was surprised and confused by this presumptuous question. But she could not speak, and so simply nodded her head.\nSatisfied, the boy left.\nHe did not know that the spring fairy was alone, without friends or family, and that she had lost a great deal of her wisdom.\nOnly when the spring water flowed from cracks in the stone into her pool, and when she gazed upon the fractured image of the moon in the rippling water, did she slowly regain the ability to think, and to mimic fragments of speech.\nLike a curious child, the fairy observed the world around her in innocence, wonder, and love. She rejoiced with the fox and squirrel who stole berries, and grieved at the dark clouds that covered the horizon.\nAnd for that young boy, a feeling complex yet immature welled forth from within her heart.\nAll alone in this world, she had neither the power nor wisdom with which to grant his wish.\nBut she could share it, and she drew life from sharing his burdens."
