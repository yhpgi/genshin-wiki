Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.\nOn the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.\nBut the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.\nFrom the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.\nThe Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.\nThrough the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that \"The God of Wisdom will never come back.\"\nShe knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.\nThus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.\n<color=#ffd780>Complete \"Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises\"</color>\nLong ago, the Dendro Archon created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through the Akademiya. Her name is praised in thousands of stories that are written to admire her deeds and virtues.\nIn the eyes of people in Sumeru, the existence of the Dendro Archon is more of a symbol — by which they ascertain that the protection of divinity upon this land has persisted since antiquity.\nThe Dendro Archon is revered by the highest sages in Sumeru City and venerated by the citizens unswervingly.\nAnd the powerful Akasha System is Lesser Lord Kusanali's eyes and ears.\nThe Akasha enables her to observe and learn about people's emotions and gives her omnipresent sight and hearing so that she can understand voices that are not praise.\nThe more she sees, the more she knows that she must learn constantly. Only through that can she enrich her experience, honing her skills to become powerful enough to face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world.\nThere is no escape from this, her inexorable duty.\nEven though very few feel unsatisfied with the status quo, Nahida still remains steadfast. Her tenacity comes from conviction. She knows it better than anyone else — that, here, she is the one that all people rely on and trust in."

She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.\nSuch dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors — they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.\nBut there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.\nFor example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.\nIt feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.\nIn such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.\nShe could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.\nBut this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida.

As she learns more knowledge, her dreams become even more intricate and full of life.\nThe dreams not only relax her mind, but also give her chances to examine her new knowledge to see if it goes against common sense or if she is missing any details.\nWhen Dusk Birds first appeared in Nahida's dream, those birds soared through the sky in a standing posture with their wings folded.\nIt looked abnormal and caught Nahida's attention immediately. Nahida thus learned how wings worked, after which the Dusk Birds could fly freely in her dreams.\nNext, she adopted similar methods to fix Shroomboars that slept underwater, Radishes that grew on apple trees, and crystalflies with mismatched wing colors.\nKnowledge shall not be a mere approach to justify things in this world, it could also be used to satisfy her need for pure innocent fun.\nTechnically, Shroomboars can only walk on the ground. Now that she understood how wings work, wouldn't Shroomboars with wings fly all the same?\nAnd where there are flying Shroomboars, it is only natural to have crocodiles that walk on their hind legs and Harra Fruits who speak human languages...\nThe way Nahida develops her knowledge system has subsequently created a little amusement park for her, free of disturbance. In her dreams, she is in the embrace of boundless happiness."

Everyone knows, after all, that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had departed a long time ago.\nA group of children gathered in secret and discussed this mystical phenomenon. Suddenly, a child who seemed to know a lot more than their peers mentioned a somewhat unusual name, \"Lesser Lord Kusanali.\"\nThey soon accepted that theory. And, of course, none of their parents believed them.\nBut what did that matter? Lesser Lord Kusanali was already their friend.\n<color=#ffd780>Complete \"Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises\"</color>\nChildren have yet to be well-informed and are easily swayed by emotions, but it does not mean that they can be disrespected or mocked.\nFrustration and disappointments do indeed grant them a taste of reality — but at the cost of robbing them of innocent thoughts and exuberant emotions.\nThe children who unluckily run across such negativity would always hear a gentle, warm voice on some ordinary night.\nShe listens attentively to the children, uses her wonderful metaphors to clarify principles to them, plays with them, and talks about their favorite games and snacks... until dawn.\nThough the night is short, such company would let the children believe that there is still someone in this world who understands them.\nHatred and frustration are thus melted away by the warmth in their hearts, and the children would gain an opportunity to make a change in their lives such that they can grow in confidence and gladness.\nHowever, none of them could recognize to whom the voice in their dreams belonged. The Dendro Archon is powerful, but she must have many more important matters to attend to. Would she really come to personally tend to a few children?\nAnd so the children gathered in secret and discussed this mystical phenomenon. Numerous were the possibilities they came up with, and they discussed at length about each imaginative explanation.\nBut in the end, the conclusion was, unsurprisingly, that only Lesser Lord Kusanali could be capable of a deed so kind and so caring. Or, to put it otherwise, that was the only conclusion that these children were willing to believe in.\nAnd, of course, none of their parents believed them. But what did that matter? Lesser Lord Kusanali was already their friend."

When one wishes to eradicate oneself, a paradox would thus occur.\nThat is why it is inevitable that one must depend on others to accomplish this goal.\nBy the time Nahida had figured this out, time was running out, leaving her no room for further consideration. The knowledge accumulated through the years could not even help her find a solution to the pressing dilemma before her.\nBut just as ████ said, as one with wisdom, one should feel joy upon the discovery of the answer.\nShe was not born just to accomplish such cruel deeds. Only after eradicating forbidden knowledge could she focus on Sumeru's future and plan for the prosperity and happiness that her nation could call its own.\nWill a nation walking into the future still remember a name that no longer exists? It does not matter.\n\"Does it really not matter?\"\nNahida would have definitely proposed otherwise. Shame, then, that their time was too short. In that blink of an eye, ████ did not even leave her a chance to retort."

Indeed, the way he saw it, there could be no bargaining chip more suitable than knowledge.\nWith one Gnosis still in her hands, Nahida could not help but hesitate. She barely knew more about the Gnoses than she knew the \"truth\" of the world.\nThe Gnosis, to her, was but a core that gathers a mass of elemental power at her discretion. But if there is nothing more to a Gnosis, why was a god so eager to gather all of them together?\nShaking hands in bargain means an equal compromise for both sides, a far cry from any victory.
