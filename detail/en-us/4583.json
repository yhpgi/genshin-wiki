It could surpass the limits of her lifespan and defend Inazuma forever. Yet, how could creating a copy of an Archon be a simple affair?</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>Ei conducted countless experiments to this effect, discarded a great many failed products, and spent an unimaginable amount of time and resources—</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>But at last, by her dogged pursuit and warrior's spirit, she was able to create a flawless puppet.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The newborn Raiden Shogun sat there silently, listening to Ei speak all about her, \"her,\" and even about them. The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The automaton had but one question to ask Ei: \"There is no turning back from forsaking your form. Do you regret nothing?\"</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>\"Your existence is my answer.\"</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>Then, Ei transferred her consciousness into her blade, and thus was born the Plane of Euthymia.</color>"
