When Traveler and Paimon went to the Jueyun Karst at the request of Fatui Harbinger Childe after the Archon’s death, Moon Carver was the first one to greet the guests. He immediately said that he was aware of Travelers’ unfair accusation and declared that he had an image of the real murderer.

After the battle, Adepti came to the conclusion to entrust the Liyue Harbor to the Liyue Qixing and not interfere in people's affairs.\nLiyue has its own fortune-telling, destiny-reading methods, similar to astrology. ​​When the Adepti rescued Shenhe, Moon Carver did once read her fortune. She was plagued by intense homicidal urges — she was thus a person of supremely ominous destiny, doomed to harm both herself and others. To ensure that she could grow up safely and not harm any innocents, the Adepti bound her soul using red ropes."

However, Madame Ping’s old friends, including Moon Carver, quite often visit her in the harbor. ​​Guests will often not only visit the stores and food stands but also attend storytelling sessions or Liyue opera performances at Heyu Tea House. Once, three outlanders, first-time visitors to Liyue Harbor, sat at the table beside that of Yaoyao and company. Having heard an opera about the Adepti of Liyue, they began to discuss that very topic over tea and snacks. Unable to get a word in lengthwise in the conversation between her master and her guest, Yaoyao succumbed to boredom, listening in on the nearby chat while eating some treats. The adventurer from Mondstadt asked the tea master if they had ever spoken to an Adeptus, only to be disappointed by the reply: <color=#ffffffd9>\"It is but a story, for we mortals do not daily dwell in Jueyun Karst, and few are the opportunities to meet the Adepti.\"</color>\nYaoyao, finding this statement to be incorrect, could not help but rebut thusly: <color=#ece5d8>\"</color> <color=#ffffffd9>That's not true.

The adepti are among us. I mean, Uncle Moon Carver just said that the story was very interesting.\"\nFor some reason she could not fathom, Madame Ping's guest stopped speaking altogether, and Madame Ping laughed, saying a few words to the tea master to change the topic.\nYaoyao, however, did not understand: Why did people find the adepti very distant from their daily lives? The adepti were amongst them — they just didn't readily reveal themselves, that's all."

        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Story 5</color>\nLiyue has its own fortune-telling, destiny-reading methods, similar to astrology.\nOf these, there are two fates that people seek to avoid at all costs.\nOne is that of the \"solitary star,\" which dictates that one will be separated from friends and family, living alone all one's days.\nThe other is \"disastrous evil,\" which means that one will face many hardships and perils.\nWhen the adepti rescued Shenhe, Moon Carver did once read her fortune.\nThe signs showed that she was marked by both the \"solitary star\" and \"disastrous evil,\" and that she was also plagued by intense homicidal urges — she was thus a person of supremely ominous destiny, doomed to harm both herself and others.\nTo ensure that she could grow up safely and not harm any innocents, the adepti bound her soul using red ropes.\nThis binding had the effect of restraining both her evil fate and her violent tendencies, but also shackled many emotions that should have originally belonged to a human.\nFrom then on, she became more and more disaffected by trivial matters, and even things most might consider important were but dust to her.\nShe became ever less human, and ever more like a lovely yet cold statue.\nBut surprisingly, she felt something stir within her when she encountered that Traveler from a distant land:\nLong-dormant emotions, now strangers to her, came loose all at once from the depths of fate's tableau.\nPerhaps it really was as Moon Carver once said: that heaven might dictate fates, but destiny's tale is written by mortals. The tale of Shenhe and the mortal world had not yet ended...\n<color=#ffd780>Vision</color>\nFew people know how the young girl in the cave, intended as a sacrifice by her own father, had been able to stand against the monster for days and nights on end by herself.\nThough Shenhe was born into an exorcist family, her maddened father had not taught her a single thing about exorcism.\nAnd like many at that innocent age, she was also wholly unused to facing life's perils alone.\nBut in that aphotic cave, bereft of parental protection — indeed, betrayed by kin — Shenhe underwent a metamorphosis.\nJust as Moon Carver's readings had shown, the sleeping calamitous fates, violent urges, and unyielding spirit within her burst their bonds all at once.\nThose things served as an unseen shield and invisible blade, arming the girl's frail form.\nThey gave her strength, gave her claws and fangs, allowing her to attack that wretched creature before her, to swear to tear it to shreds — to prove that she, and not it, was the cruelest evil that stalked the darkness.\nTheir life-and-death battle across the next few days was one without end. Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...\nAs the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.\nWith the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.\nThe vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.\nIn the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate. In the future, it would also lead her back to the mortal realm."

This is one school of thought.\nAnother can be found in the classic treatise on metal and stone, \"Void-Pacing Stone Catalog.\" While showering praise upon the weird and wonderful rock formations of Jueyun Karst, \"Stone Catalog\" also proffers a warning: \"The peaks of Jueyun tower up to lofty heights, striving to outdo one another... each belonging to a different master — Qingyun Peak to Moon Carver, Mt. Hulao to Mountain Shaper, Mt. Aocang to Cloud Retainer. The wise climb not a mastered mountain, nor quarry its rocks.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 1</color>\nEvery second of every day, Liyue Harbor bustles with throngs of people coming and going. Local businessman weighed down by sacks of gold, outlanders garbed in strange attire, shrewd and canny public servants, warm-hearted guards... People from all walks of life with all sorts of personalities mingle, to the extent that no one looks out of place.\nWhen someone new suddenly appears in a city like this, people don't bat an eyelid.\nThis particular newcomer to Liyue Harbor is a woman who goes by the name of Xianyun. Tall and slender, she wears a pair of red-rimmed spectacles and exudes an aura that makes her stand out from the crowd.\nTo the Fontainian merchants who sell their mechanical creations on the streets of Liyue, she's already a familiar figure. When passing by, she invariably stops to discuss mechanical design with them — and once such discussions get started, entire afternoons fly by before anyone notices. She seems well acquainted with Chef Mao and Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant as well, and is often to be seen sitting at a table opposite Guoba, waiting for a bowl of piping hot Dragon Beard Noodles. And she's also made an impression on the waiters of both Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion, where she sometimes dines as the guest of Mr. Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Granny Shan, the toy seller, remembers her too. If memory serves, she'd tell you, Xianyun's the one who often brings along a young woman with long, white hair to look at her kites and other trinkets. The young woman, whose name she now recalls is Shenhe, never seems to find anything that takes her fancy — yet Xianyun always brings her back nonetheless.\nJust like many other residents of Liyue Harbor, it seems that Xianyun not only has hobbies of her own, but also travels widely and has many friends.\nSo when people see her chatting with Madame Ping by the fish pond nearby Yujing Terrace, they think nothing of it.\n\"I haven't seen much of Mountain Shaper lately. And Moon Carver still hasn't returned that Multi-Purpose Abode Cleaning Talisman I lent him, to this day...\"\n\"Is that so? What might that be then, some sort of new sigil contraption you've come up with?\"\n\"Yes, let me tell you all about it...\"\n<color=#ffd780>Jadevoid</color>\nLegend has it that the place where an adeptus resides is known as their Jadevoid. The adeptal abodes tucked away among the peaks of Jueyun Karst are just such places.\nThe word \"Jadevoid\" originates from a spot among the clouds high above Qingyun Peak which overlooks the world below. This is a place that has rarely been seen by mortal eyes.\n\"Jade\" refers to the foundation of this place, which was made from a single piece of Plaustrite — hence why it floats above the clouds.\nThe true way is found in emptiness, and thus can be attained by traversing the void. Once, those who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the trials of heaven and earth. This place served as the trial of \"heaven.\"\nOriginally, however, the Jadevoid was not created by the adepti as a test of the spirit. Instead, it was created by Cloud Retainer as a locale for reflection and meditation. It was only later that Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper persuaded her to lend this place for the benefit of those who might come seeking the adeptal path. Hearing that Rex Lapis had given his assent and that Guizhong and Streetward Rambler both agreed as well, Cloud Retainer readily gave up the Jadevoid and had a small pavilion built upon it.\nNowadays, few are able to follow the adeptal path, and the Jadevoid — almost nothing now but a legend among mortals — has returned to the care of Cloud Retainer. But today, returning to this place above the clouds, her state of mind has changed.\nThough the vast sea of clouds and the sight of the sun as it rises and sets are as magnificent as ever, her thoughts have begun to drift off to the lively bustle of the mortal world.\nNow, she yearns to live alongside the humans under the name of Xianyun.\n\"As it just so happens, I'm starting to feel hungry. How about... some of Wanmin Restaurant's delectable Crab Roe Tofu.\""

There was one year when it snowed heavily in Liyue, and Mt. Aocang was covered in several feet of snow. Seeing everyone cooped up in their abodes with nothing to do, one created a Snowdrift Mechanism for skiing on the mountains. One was having a tremendous time of it along with Guizhong and Streetward Rambler... until, of course, Moon Carver noticed as much and decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snow bank. It took us hours to dig him out... Later, one introduced a great many safety features to the mechanism, to the point where it could be safely piloted by even a three-year-old child. Although this did entail a compromise on the top speed of the vehicle."
