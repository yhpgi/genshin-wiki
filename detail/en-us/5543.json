What is it?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nI behold your immaculate appearance, with eyes as bright as shining stars/your extraordinary beauty, a divinity in this mortal world, and know from this one glance that you nobly wander this land. Therefore, prithee tarry a while, as I make so bold to request your good name?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Not bad. You've got good eyes for some old guy!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, your breathtaking confidence is a rarity. I have certainly not erred!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat in the world are you banging on about... You too, Traveler! Don't let a few compliments go to your head!\nAhem, anyway, Paimon at your service. He's/She's Traveler. And you are...?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Huh? Are you talking to me?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nPrecisely! I perceived your uncommon demeanor with one glance. You must also be an itinerant hero/heroine, are you not?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEr, dunno about any itinerant whatevers. But anyway, Paimon, at your service. He's/She's Traveler. And you are...?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAh, yes. Where are my manners? Huang the Third of the Guhua Clan, at your service. Some people know me as the Cloudpiercing Arrow.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nCloudpiercing Arrow...? So you're a talented archer?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, it was just a moniker bestowed on me in my youth. Pay it no mind.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nOh, so you're Huang the Third! The one they call the Cloudpiercing Arrow...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, don't tell Paimon you've heard of this guy!?\nWait a minute, did you just say... Guhua Clan?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nOh? Are you familiar with our clan's name?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It rings a bell.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Now, where did I hear about it...?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nExcellent, excellent! I thought the Clan's fortunes had waned so much that its name was now all but forgotten. I did not expect you to be so well-informed.\nTo be frank, I approached you because I am inviting select interested parties to visit Wangshan Hall, our Clan stronghold, and explore history itself.\nIf you have nowhere pressing to be, how about coming with me to see the Hall? I promise you won't be disappointed!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>You're turning your stronghold into a tourist attraction?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nErr... Well, our disciples are scattered all over Liyue. As the Hall is currently deserted, what better time to invite guests?\nWhat's more, it contains treasures never before seen...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I'm not all that interested...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nI see... Alas! Would it not be a shame if the treasures housed still within Wangshan Hall will remain thus neglected, deep within the mountains...! A shame. Such a shame!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh? Treasures!?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nQuite so! Grand Master Guhua secretly established 12 Secret Chambers within the Hall upon the Clan's founding, in which he placed treasures now lost to the world.\nWangshan Hall is hewn from the mountain stone itself, and its structure is complex and intricate. Over millennia, only a handful of these hidden chambers have been discovered. The locations of many others are unknown even to us disciples.\nI sense something special about you. Perchance you might stumble across one of Grand Master Guhua's hidden chambers during your visit to this historical site!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(This has to be a gimmick to sucker tourists in...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Surely no one could fall for this...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n12 Secret Chambers!? For real!? Traveler, Traveler! We've gotta see this! Y'know, and those secret Guhua Clan treasures!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, what's with that look? Aren't you tempted at all? We'll be rich if we find that forgotten treasure!\nOh! That reminds Paimon... Isn't Xingqiu a member of the Guhua Clan? Maybe he once trained there!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nFine then. Lead the way, Paimon.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, awesome! Paimon just knew that you'd be interested!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nHang on, how much does it cost to tour Wangshan Hall?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nCost? Haha, surely you jest! We are honorable disciples of the Guhua Clan, and wish only to invite those of character to come visit. We are not brash, swindling charlatans!\nI'm not asking for a penny! How about it, then? Would you care to proceed to Wangshan Hall to explore our illustrious history?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Great, that's just what I was thinking!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, you certainly are direct!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Since it's free, we might as well go take a look...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWonderful! Well, without further ado, I'll go plan a sightseeing route for you both! Please, simply follow the map straight to Wangshan Hall!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third takes his leave...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nGreat! Let's go soon, Traveler! Paimon can't wait!\n<color=#ece5d8>Outside Wangshan Hall</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to Huang the Third</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n(No... How can you take those antiques out without maintaining them!? What if...)\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\n(Hey, you don't get it... If I did that, and people saw that the paint was new, would they still be willing to come play... I mean, come train!? The sense of history is... whatchamacallit... Hey!)\n(...And anyway, the two of us don't have that much spare cash...)\nOh, oh... Welcome! I see you've made it to our stronghold — Wangshan Hall!\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nErr... and who's this?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, worry not! This is my junior brother, known in our circles as Wen the Fourth, and by the people as the Snowstriding Sword.\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nWelcome, welcome.\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHowever, Wangshan Hall is, in the end, very important to us. Custom dictates, therefore, that outsiders who wish to enter must first pass two trials.\nPut another way, we first wish to see just how skilled you are!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Hmph, don't underestimate us!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n(Well, just look what gullible fish just got on the hook...)\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nOf course, of course! These two tests will certainly be a walk in the park for your illustrious selves!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>This is so troublesome...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, no need to worry! These two tests will certainly be a walk in the park for your illustrious selves!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nIt's just that these are the rules of our clan, and we can't simply change them arbitrarily. Please forgive me.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nBoo... Nothing for it. We do want the treasure from those 12 Secret Chambers...\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nThe 12 Secret Chambers, eh? Haven't you told these guests a lot? Did you count those chambers specifically...?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nTsk...\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nWhatever. Go on, go on.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSo, what exactly do I need to do?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nIt's very simple. Please, follow me!\n<color=#ffffff73>Optional Dialogue:</color> Talk to Wen the Fourth\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Tell me about the trials...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nOutsiders who seek to enter Wangshan Hall must pass two trials. This rule has existed since ancient times.\nHowever... Forget it, if my senior thinks it's all right, then I have nothing to say about it. Anyway, there's nothing to worry about. Anyone can pass the trials as they are right now.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nHuh? What do you mean?\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...You will understand soon enough. Go on, don't let me keep you. My senior is waiting.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We'll be on our way then. Goodbye!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nGo on, my senior is waiting.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> According to Huang the Third, anyone wishing to enter Wangshan Hall who is not a disciple must first pass two trials...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Follow Huang the Third to the site of the trial</color>\n<color=#ece5d8>Plum Blossom Pole Trial</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Learn about the rules for the trial</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nBehold the Plumwatcher Piles, passed down by Grand Master Guhua!\nIt was upon these stones that Grand Master Guhua practiced back in the day, diligently cultivating the technique to become a true master! Over there, the ancient trees were also planted by our founder's hand...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWow, they're all at crazy angles, and some are even broken in half...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nIt's probably due to years of disrepair and neglect...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAhem... Of course not! It's merely to increase the difficulty of the training, nothing more! After all, there won't be neat stone piles to step on in a real battle, will there?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNobody would step on one of these things in a real fight either!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\n...In any case! For the first trial, I ask that you step on the stone piles in the order I specify within the allotted time, Traveler. Show me what you've got!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Heh, piece of cake!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>This is so troublesome...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nC'mon, Traveler, you've got this! If you wanna get the treasure... Ahem, Paimon means, if you wanna pass the trial, you've gotta be willing to put in the effort!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAlright then. You're up, Traveler!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Complete the trial!</color>\nThe additional dialogue appears during the trial if the player successfully climbed onto the poles.\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nSimply incredible! This way next, please.\nNot bad! Your skill is truly extraordinary, Young Hero/Young Heroine!\nOkay! Almost there, one last step!\nThe additional dialogue appears during the trial if the player fell into the water.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWah! Into the drink... Th—That didn't count! Again!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, there are no do-overs in life! Young Hero/Young Heroine‍, fret not. Whether we rise or fall, it is all but part of the trial! What matters is to press on.\nThe additional dialogue appears during the trial if the player don't move to the next pole.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, Traveler, stop zoning out! At this rate, we'll fail the trial!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Receive Huang the Third's evaluation</color>\nThere are 5 scenarios for the following dialogue:\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 1:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player completed the Trial successfully.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nSuch extraordinary technique! You moved like a swallow in flight, with not a droplet of water staining your wings. Such unparalleled grace is truly worthy of a hero!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Heh, it was nothing!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I almost fell...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm... Does using a wind glider count as a technique?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.\nI ask you this: When a wandering hero strides out and brings bandits and thieves alike to justice, was it their skill that deserves credit, or their sword's?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... The hero's skill, of course!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nCorrect! Even the sharpest blade is ineffective in the hands of one who knows not how to wield it.\nIt is by this same reasoning that Traveler could use his/her wind glider so superbly. This is the kind of mastery we strive for in Guhua martial arts!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm, that does make sense. But it also doesn't make sense at all...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWith that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, Traveler! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI won't lose!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's right, and Paimon will be cheering you on!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 2:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player fell into the water.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, Traveler, are you okay?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>*sniff* I fell because I wasn't looking...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's all because these poles are too dang slippery!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nCome on, be careful! *sigh* It's a good thing there's only water under these poles... Had it been solid ground, you probably would have gotten hurt.\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nSuch extraordinary technique! You moved with remarkable finesse, like a swallow in flight. Such unparalleled grace is truly worthy of a hero!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n???\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? What are you talking about? Traveler fell right into the water! Good thing he/she can swim...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nYou see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.\nBut how could a few stone piles gauge the limits of your extraordinary technique? Doubtless, you intentionally went off the beaten path and dropped into the water to display your true skill...\nYou fell exactly above the array's core, and as you swam back ashore, you perfectly undid said array. Others may not understand these profundities, but how could it ever escape me, the Cloudpiercing Arrow?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>You are wise indeed!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh... Are you two being serious?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Are you for real?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWith that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, Traveler! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI won't lose!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo, but you didn't win either!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 3:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player ran out of time.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWoah, time's up already...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n*sniff* We were so close...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nSuch extraordinary technique! You moved like a swallow in flight, with not a droplet of water staining your wings. Such unparalleled grace is truly worthy of a hero!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n???\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWait! How the heck did you come to that conclusion!? It wasn't completed at all!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nYou see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.\nLet me ask you a question. Did your companion lose his/her footing and fall into the water?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWell... No...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAnd that is where the secret lies! If the goal was only to follow the rules and move about on the wooden piles, then it would have been a piece of cake with Traveler's agility.\nBut the great do not allow themselves to be bound by rules!\nJust clearing the first few wooden piles was enough to prove Traveler's skill, and standing firm afterward demonstrated uncompromising will! An admirable combination of integrity and skill, indeed!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Exactly!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh... Are you two being serious?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Just staying out of the water is considered a success?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWith that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, Traveler! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nHaha! Defeat is impossible!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo, but you didn't win either!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 4:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player did not attempt the Trial and ran out of time.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey! Why are you just standing there?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I, er, got distracted...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOh, come on, how could you get distracted at a time like this?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nExcellent! Only a true hero like you could have immediately seen through the true essence of this trial!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n???\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nIf the goal was only to follow the rules and move about on the stone piles, then I'm sure Traveler's agility would have made short work of it.\nBut Traveler stood still on the spot. Now, why is that?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... Because he/she was distracted...?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's, uh, just really high up...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYou say that, but Paimon doesn't think you've ever been scared of heights before...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nExcellent! Only a true hero like you could have immediately seen through the true essence of this trial!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n???\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nIf the goal was only to follow the rules and move about on the stone piles, then I'm sure Traveler's agility would have made short work of it.\nBut Traveler stood still on the spot. Now, why is that?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... Because he/she was afraid...?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.\nYou see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.\nAs our predecessors once said, the prudent should foresee danger and take precautions. This is exactly what they meant! And Traveler would rather give up on the trial than betray this principle. Truly admirable!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>You are wise indeed!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh... Are you two being serious?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Are you for real?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWith that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, Traveler! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI won't lose!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYou didn't even try!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 5:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player drowned in the water.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, Traveler, are you okay?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>*sniff* I fell because I wasn't looking...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Well, now I can say I've definitely drunk enough!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, that's not something to be proud of! You could've gotten hurt there! Seriously, take better care of yourself!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nExcellent! Who knew you could hold your breath underwater for so long and still seem so alive after being fished out... No, you're completely fine! A true hero indeed!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n???\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat do you mean, holding his/her breath underwater!? He/She clearly swallowed a ton of water down there!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, it looks like you still have much to learn about traditional martial arts, child.\nI ask you this: When a wandering hero strides out and brings bandits and thieves alike to justice, was it their skill that deserves credit, or their sword's?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... The hero's skill, of course... Wait! What has that go to do with anything?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nEverything! Everyone knows that holding your breath in the open air is part of the basics while holding your breath underwater is the supreme technique!\nAs they say, the form of martial arts is fluid, and anything can be a sword. Even flowers and leaves can harm others. Traveler's mastery, therefore, is truly admirable!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Exactly!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... Nothing you said seems to have any connection with that...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I have no idea myself...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nYou see... This trial is meant to test visitors against these stone piles.\nSince you've displayed an extraordinary ability to hold your breath, you've been tested sufficiently and sufficient!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThis makes no sense at all!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWith that, let me congratulate you on acing the first trial, Traveler! For the second trial, we must proceed to the practice arena. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI won't lose!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat are you so happy about!?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Follow Huang the Third to the site of the next trial</color>\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Wen the Fourth\nThe alternative dialogue appears if the player completed the Trial successfully.\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...Skilled.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Huh?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nI said you're skilled.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nThanks for the compliment.\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nBut you need more practice if you seek to further yourself.\nI saw the way you moved just now. I won't comment on the details, but it was pretty good overall. I'm certain it will become a great weapon in your arsenal if you work hard on it.\nHah... I may say that, but even now, it far surpasses anything my senior is capable of.\nThe alternative dialogue appears if the player failed the Trial.\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>You seem hesitant to say something...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Hey! So what do you think about my skill!?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nForget it... If my senior thinks it's all right, then I have nothing to say about it. So don't ask me.\nI never expected our clan to end up in such a state... Yet there is nothing that can be done...\n<color=#ece5d8>Martial Trial</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Learn about the rules for the trial</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nBehold, our practice arena!\nBack then, the reputation of the Guhua Clan was known throughout Liyue. But what was it based on? It was based on the spear and sword skills developed right here!\nThe dual mastery of polearm and sword we are known for is the result of arduous practice, day after day!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n(There's nobody here...)\n(Is this where Xingqiu used to train then?)\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nThis is the second trial, the Trial of Spear and Sword! Just one moment while I get the training equipment out...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third produces a bunch of dusty bamboo dummies from somewhere...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nPhew, I'm exhausted... Okay! Anyway, would you please display your skills on these dummies?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSure, but what exactly should I do?\nSurely you don't expect me to knock all these dummies down in two seconds flat or something...?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, surely you jest! Who could train in such a ludicrous fashion?\nTake a look. Some of these dummies are dressed in blue while others are dressed in red.\nThe battlefield may turn on a dime. You must be able to distinguish friend from foe. To clear this trial, defeat all the dummies dressed in red within the allotted time!\nIf you strike a dummy dressed in blue, you lose. Stay alert, Traveler!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOoh, Paimon gets it! So, you have to attack the dummies in red without hitting a single dummy in blue...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Pff, simple. Behold my power!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nGreat! That's the spirit! In this case, let's get started!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Can you repeat that, Paimon?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? Let's see... Paimon thinks he's saying you can only hit... the ones in blue, right? But you can't hit any of the ones in red...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nYou've got it the wrong way around! You must attack all the dummies dressed in red without hitting a single one that's dressed in blue!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Could you say that one more time?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nEh? It's... You have to hit all those dressed in... Ahem, anyway, you get the idea!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Oh, I see! The second trial is a tongue twister...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIt really isn't! Even though Paimon's a little confused... At least, just hit all the dummies of one color, which is... red? Probably...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Complete the trial!</color>\nThe additional dialogue appears during the trial if the player hit a blue-clothed dummy.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh? Looks like a blue-clothed dummy was hit...\n...Wait, is it red or blue that should be hit? Let me think for a moment... Ah, forget it! Just hit all of one color, that'll be good enough!\nThe additional dialogue appears during the trial if the player does not attack a dummy.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, Traveler, stop zoning out! At this rate, we'll fail the trial!\nThe additional dialogue appears during the trial if the player hit a blue-clothed dummy and time is running out.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWaaah! Oh no, Paimon remembered! Huang the Third wanted us to hit all the red-clothed dummies, but we accidentally hit a blue one!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Receive Huang the Third's evaluation</color>\nThere are 5 scenarios for the following dialogue:\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 1:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player completed the Trial successfully.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWoohoo! That means we've successfully cleared the stage, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It was a piece of cake!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>What a chore... There shouldn't be anything else after this, right?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nA—Amazing! You effortlessly defeated all the targets with outstanding speed and accuracy! Even among our disciples, few can ever hope to rival you!\nAre you the master of another clan, here on some secret visit?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Indeed. I'm, in truth, the master of the Paimon Clan...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nOh! You're the Pai... Uh... So you're the master of another clan! It is an honor to meet you, an honor indeed!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat in the world... That's enough nonsense, Traveler! Identifying targets is child's play to combat veterans like us!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>...Huh?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNah... Identifying targets is just child's play to combat veterans like us!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHahaha! I would expect nothing less from someone as skilled as you, Traveler!\nAnyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe! Wangshan Hall's treasures, here we come!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 2:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player destroyed a blue-clothed dummy.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, we accidentally hit one of those dummies in blue!\nThere goes the stage, and the treasure with it...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That didn't count! Again!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's all because this platform is too dang slippery!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nA—Amazing! You saw through such a meticulous disguise with a single glance!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nThe dummies in blue Traveler just hit were the spies hiding among us!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm... How could you tell?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha! Don't you understand, little one? As they say, you never know what lurks on the inside. How could they be distinguished by appearance alone?\nYet, Traveler saw through their appearance and peered into their very nature! Such perception truly is the pinnacle of skill!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Exactly!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWait! Just wait! Dummies don't have a \"nature\"! And you, Traveler! Stop looking so smug! It was just an accident, wasn't it!?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Are you even listening to yourself right now...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAnyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTh—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 3:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player destroyed a blue-clothed dummy without destroying any red-clothed dummies.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, we accidentally hit one of those dummies in blue!\nWe also didn't manage to hit all the ones in red... There goes the stage, and also the treasure...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That didn't count! Again!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's all because this platform is too dang slippery!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nA—Amazing! You saw through such a meticulous disguise with a single glance!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nThe dummies in blue Traveler just hit were the impostors hiding among us! And the dummies in red that were spared? They were our undercover agents!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm... and how could you tell?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha! Don't you understand, little one? As they say, you never know what lurks on the inside. How could they be distinguished by appearance alone?\nYet, Traveler saw through their appearance and peered into their very nature!

Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTh—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 4:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player ran out of time but did not attack any blue-clothed dummies.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWoah, time's up...\nThere goes the stage, and the treasure with it...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That didn't count! Again!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's all because this platform is too dang slippery!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nA—Amazing! You saw through such a meticulous disguise with a single glance!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nThe dummies in red that Traveler just spared were our undercover agents! Hitting them by accident would be no different from hitting ourselves on the head!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nU—Undercover agents? How could you tell?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha! Don't you understand, little one? As they say, you never know what lurks on the inside.

And you, Traveler! Stop looking so smug! You just failed to finish them off, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Are you even listening to yourself right now...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAnyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTh—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!\n<color=#ffffff>Scenario 5:</color> <color=#ffffff>The player ran out of time and did not attack any dummies.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTraveler! Why are you just standing there?\nThere goes the stage, and the treasure with it...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I lost concentration for a sec, that's all...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWow, Paimon didn't know you could zone out even at a time like this...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Huh? What did you just say?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey! Stop messing with Paimon!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I have no idea which ones I'm supposed to hit...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... Well, you do have a point... How are we supposed to know which ones to hit between all the dummies of different colors...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nExcellent! I've never met someone so understanding and righteous in all my life! I truly admire you!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWait! There's nothing to admire about that! Traveler just stood there on the spot!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha! You fail to see beyond the surface of things!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nTraveler's skill is more than enough to instantly take down all those dummies in red. But that is not the Way.\nSome swords in this world take life, and some give it. Taking life is easy, and giving it, hard. And the greatest principle in martial arts is to not kill!\nWhile they may be dummies made of bamboo, they still symbolize living beings. Traveler's compassion and decision to feign distraction just to protect the innocent, even at the cost of failing the trial... It's truly admirable!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Heh!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat the heck is this nonsense... Hey, Traveler! Stop looking so smug! You were just distracted, weren't you!?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Well, I really was distracted...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha! There's no need for humility! I'm fully capable of distinguishing your true intent!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAnyway, as you've passed two trials, you've naturally earned the right to visit Wangshan Hall. Please come with me!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTh—That's a pass? Well... As long as it gets us in... Look out, Treasures of Guhua, 'cause here we come!\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Wen the Fourth\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nIf you have anything to ask about the Guhua Clan... Feel free to ask me. As for what my senior said... Don't believe everything he says.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Tell me about Wangshan Hall...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nWangshan Hall is the main house of the Guhua Clan and where Grand Master Guhua attained enlightenment.\nNow, it is in ruins and unusable... Besides my senior and I, no one else remains to guard this place.\nEven our current Master merely visits occasionally.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>So, what's the clan's history...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nThe Guhua Clan was once known as the Guhua Brotherhood. We looked up to the chivalry of Grand Master Guhua and traveled the world with our swords and spears... Our mastery of both was known to all.\nSigh... But as time passed, the clan's glory was no more...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Mastery over spear and sword?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nExactly. The Guhua Clan has three ultimate techniques — Light Piercer, Rain Cutter, and Life Ender. The three were known as the Three Guhua Greats.\nLife Ender is a unique fusion of sword and spear, and it is why the Guhua Clan is known to have mastery over both.\nIt is said that Life Ender could slice wind, split waves, and destroy mountains. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to witness it for myself.\nLater on, during the time of the 11th Master... Yingmin, the one known as the Piercing Blade, felt that these techniques were too difficult to master and unsuitable for widespread study. Slight modifications were made to develop a new set of entry-level techniques...\nAnd the outcome of that was... Few were willing to give up the easily attainable for hard work, and fewer and fewer were willing to meditate and spend decades on the original teachings of Grand Master Guhua...\nAs time flashed by, our three ultimate techniques gradually became legendary, yet their power was ever-weakening. Our clan's vigor wound up declining and faith in it was lost... A shame. A shame, indeed...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I see...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Tell me about the Guhua Clan...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nGrand Master Guhua was our founder, but not the clan's first master.\nThe grand master was a wandering hero who brought peace and justice to the people while traveling the world. He never intended to start a clan. This place wasn't always known as Wangshan Hall, instead being known as the \"Lingmeng Chamber.\"\nAfter the grand master passed away, Boxuan... better known as Master Baixuan, who once received his favor, established the Guhua Brotherhood in his name and called himself a disciple of Guhua to carry on the grand master's legacy.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSo they were a self-proclaimed disciple?\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nIndeed. The grand master never took one.\nUnfortunately, the glory of the clan faded with time. We, disciples of future generations, failed the clan. Now, we no longer seek to restore the clan's glory, merely to uphold justice and live up to the grand master's name.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nAnd that's why the disciples of the Guhua Clan are spread all over Liyue?\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nExactly. After all, there are places in the world where the sun doesn't shine, and we cannot leave everything to Rex Lapis.\nBut... My only consolation is a promising junior — Xingqiu. If he can restore our former glory... Then we of the older generation can die without regrets.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I want to take a look at Wangshan Hall.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...Forgive me for not accompanying you. Farewell.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> Anyway, now that you've breezed through the trials, it's time to check out Wangshan Hall!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Open Wangshan Hall's gates</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Enter Wangshan Hall</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Tour Wangshan Hall with Huang the Third</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nBehold, the lifeblood of our clan for a millennium — Wangshan Hall!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Wow!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Is this really it? It looks like it's seen better days...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWhen Grand Master Guhua founded our clan, this was a place of untold majesty where great heroes from all over gathered in merriment and endless song...\nEven the realm of the adepti pales in comparison to Wangshan Hall!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm... Speaking of which, what does the name mean anyway?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, I'll tell you! Legend has it that when Grand Master Guhua wandered the world, his sword terrified all bandits, and the countryside boasted of being as peaceful as the city...\nThe mountain thieves were as frightened of Guhua as they were of tigers. The tiger is king over the beasts, and thus did the locals under the grand master's protection call this place Wangshan Hall out of respect for his supremacy over the mountains.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Oh, I see!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Wouldn't it have been called something like Mighty Tiger Mountain then?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's super weird! Wangshan Hall sounds way cooler!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAhem... Anyway, for a thousand years since then, the Guhua Clan has tirelessly honed its martial arts techniques here...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Ooh!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Honed this place into the ground, more like...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nCome! I'll show you around. Follow me around this Guhua Sword-Honing Stone...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n(Traveler, Traveler, keep your eyes peeled! Maybe we'll find some clues concerning the treasures!)\nA cutscene plays.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUm, Huang the Third... The way you're walking...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha! How embarrassing! Anyway, this is the Guhua Clan's secret movement technique — Soaring Swallow! Forgive me for not showing it to you earlier, but it's a rule of our clan...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUm, Paimon just wanted to ask... You're shaking like a leaf all of a sudden. Are you not feeling well? Or do you just need a break...\nFollow Huang the Third\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nBehold! This is the arsenal of Wangshan Hall! Spears, swords, halberds... Anything you can think of, you'll find it here!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAnything and everything?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAh. As ever, this is such a wondrous sight! Although only a few shields and spears remain, I'm sure the grand scenes of the past are already flashing before your eyes!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Speak with Huang the Third and go to the next location</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third</color> <color=#ffffff>:</color>\nWhat do you think? If you've seen enough of this place, shall I bring you to the next spot, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Sure, let's go.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Not so fast. I'd like to get a closer look around...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Tour Wangshan Hall with Huang the Third</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, as expected of a long-standing martial arts clan...\nLook, Traveler! Even the pillars here have been engraved with so many sword-wielding figures...\nHuh? There seems to be a censer here.\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, good eye! The memorial tablet of our ancestral founder, Guhua, is enshrined here!\nOur grand master traveled the world, and the only reason the clan has lasted a thousand years is because the world admires his virtue and remembers him with gratitude.\nThis tablet is here to remind future generations of our clan to never forget the teachings of our ancestors... To help those in need and bring peace to the people.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Speak with Huang the Third and go to the next location</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWhat do you think? If you've seen enough of this place, shall I bring you to the next spot, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Sure, let's go.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Not so fast. I'd like to get a closer look around...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Tour Wangshan Hall with Huang the Third</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to Huang the Third</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? Why is this locked?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, this is the Arcane Archive, where all the ancient mysteries and secrets of the Guhua Clan are hidden, so only our own disciples are allowed within.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIs that so... This is as far as we go, then!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nAlright! That concludes the tour of Wangshan Hall!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? It's over already? What about the treasures?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, treasure isn't something you just randomly find! You know, in all these centuries, many a disciple has sought out the grand master's treasures, but none have succeeded...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOh... In that case, let's take another look around nearby!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nNot so fast! If you wish to continue exploring our clan's secrets, you must follow its rules with a show of good faith.\nTake Grand Master Guhua for example — in his time, disciples who wished to master spear and sword also had to pay tuition...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh!? But we're not disciples!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>What she said!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We agreed there'd be no fee!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nPaimon's never heard of the Guhua Clan cheating people of their Mora either!\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nThat's... We're not cheating people of anything! Ahem... We don't need Mora, exactly, but rules are rules! In Grand Master Guhua's time, it wasn't Mora he accepted, but rice and salted meat...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? So, you want food, not money?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWell... *sigh* Fine, if you don't have Mora, you can just make me something to eat! That's what our predecessors did. As a great hero, surely that's within your means?\nAfter all, we value a helping hand in times of need. It's all up to you, as long as it's from the heart. I have no intention of extorting you, Traveler — I just wouldn't want you to have a guilty conscience!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I certainly am a great hero of our times...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo, Traveler! Don't let him get to you!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>And if my conscience is clear?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nYou, you...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmph, you just want something to eat, don't you!? We'll make you something to eat!\n(Traveler, Traveler! Paimon has an idea!)\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n(Oh? What is it?)\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n(Hehe... You'll see! Follow Paimon's lead!)\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Huang the Third\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nI'm not sure what delicacy you've prepared, but I'll just wait over here!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> Paimon seems to have an idea of some sort...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Step to the side and listen to Paimon's idea</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmph! Didn't he say \"The Guhua Clan used to accept rice and salted meat\"? Then why don't we fulfill his wish, and make him some salted meat?\n<color=#ffffff>Seemingly fired up by the thought, the usually-lazy Paimon begins to set up a campfire all by herself...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIt's supposed to be a salted dish, so it doesn't really matter how much salt we actually cover this thing with, right?\nAnyway, let's grill it first...\nUgh, Paimon feels a little bad, ruining perfectly good food... No, no, it's too late to feel bad about it now! And either way, it's all that guy's fault!\nNow it's time to add the salt! Hehe, Paimon will leave that to you, Traveler!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>This might be a bit too much...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWh—What do you mean? Hey, if anyone's going a bit too far, wouldn't it be that guy? He tricked us into coming here with the promise of treasure, and even wanted us to cook for him for free!\nSomeone like that has to be taught a lesson! If he doesn't learn that what he's doing is wrong, he will just continue to scam other people once we leave this place! Isn't that right, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n(Add a small pinch of salt.)\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Add a small pinch of salt.)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThere's no need to be stingy! You can add more, like this—\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n(Add two pinches of salt.)\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYep, now that's more like it! Keep going!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Add two pinches of salt.)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Add three pinches of salt.)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Add three pinches of salt.)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Add four pinches of salt!)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Add four pinches of salt!)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Add a \"proper amount\" of salt!)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nForget it, doing it like this takes too long... Why don't we just dump all the rest of the stuff in?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Alright, you're the boss...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Then let's dump everything in!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWoohoo! It's done! This is Paimon's specialty salted meat dish!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Truly mouthwatering!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nChoke-full of karma!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I could have sworn I also saw something strange get added in...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh, it was probably nothing!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAnyway, let's bring this to Huang the Third right away!\nObtain"

And Paimon bets all that talk about the treasures was just to bum a free meal! Do you really think you can outrun the Millelith?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHold on a moment! Don't get the Millelith involved, please! I'm a martial artist and a proper, senior member of the Guhua Clan!

There may not be \"12 Secret Chambers\" in Wangshan Hall, but the relic really does exist! We modern disciples just don't know where it is.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat's the difference? Hmph! We're gonna tell the Millelith that you're a mean old man who's deliberately swindling tourists, cheating them out of their food, and... and...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nOkay, okay! I've received a lot of tourists in my time here, but hardly any as honest as you two...\nHow about this, to repay you for not reporting me to the authorities, I'll make an exception. I'll give you the key to the library. There are countless secret martial arts books in there. Surely they also count as \"treasures\"?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third produces a big set of keys...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh, and these keys are...?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nThey're all the same, they're all spare keys to the library.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhy do you have so many spares?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, at my age, I'm afraid I'll lose them. Here, take this one.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nBut if you lost one, wouldn't you lose them all?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's right... Wait a minute, we were just threatening to report you. Why are you suddenly giving us something so important?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>True, especially if they're the genuine secret texts of the Guhua Clan...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Aren't you worried we might actually be bad people?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\n...To be honest, the tourists from before paid in Mora, which I used to maintain the things buried here.\nNot that there's much left of the Guhua Clan now... The only ones left here who still have any desire to return and keep things running are a few of us old folks.\nIt's just a shame. At our age, we have the will, but not the strength... You two saw how run-down the place is. The most we can do now is keep the dust at bay.\nHaha. If Grand Master Guhua were still around, I'm sure he'd laugh at our powerlessness.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuang the Third...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nBut the Guhua Clan's thousand-year legacy can't just be buried along with us old folks, can it? I can tell that you're good people... and good people are hard to come by these days.\nYour willingness to humor an old fool like me brought some life back into this place...

Anyway, that's enough of this sentimental talk. Let's just say I'm giving the key to you so you won't report me.\nTraveler... No, Mr./Ms. Traveler, you may stay here as long as you like.

Grand Master Guhua secretly established 12 Secret Chambers within the Hall upon the Clan's founding, in which he placed treasures now lost to the world.\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n12 Secret Chambers, eh? That's very specific of you. Did you take the time to count them yourself...?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nTsk...\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nWhatever. Go on, go on.\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nWangshan Hall is hewn from the mountain stone itself, and its structure is complex and intricate. Over millennia, only a handful of these hidden chambers have been discovered. The locations of many others are unknown even to us disciples.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Actually, we were just passing through...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nI see... Alas! Would it not be a shame if the treasures housed still within Wangshan Hall will remain thus neglected, deep within the mountains...! A shame. Such a shame!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh? Treasures!?\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nQuite so! Grand Master Guhua secretly established 12 Secret Chambers within the Hall upon the Clan's founding, in which he placed treasures now lost to the world.\nWangshan Hall is hewn from the mountain stone itself, and its structure is complex and intricate. Over millennia, only a handful of these hidden chambers have been discovered. The locations of many others are unknown even to us disciples.\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nOh... Even we disciples don't know where they are, and you're bringing outsiders in?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nBrother, you... Calm yourself. Stop interrupting me!\nI sense something special about you. Perchance you might stumble across one of Grand Master Guhua's hidden chambers during your visit to this historical site!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(This has to be a gimmick to sucker tourists in...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Surely no one could fall for this...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nFor real!? Traveler, Traveler! Let's go see those secret Guhua Clan treasures, shall we?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, what's with that look? Aren't you tempted at all? We'll be rich if we find that forgotten treasure!\nOh! That reminds Paimon... Isn't Xingqiu a member of the Guhua Clan? Maybe he once trained here!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nFine then. Lead the way, Paimon.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, awesome! Paimon just knew that you'd be interested!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nHang on, how much does it cost to tour Wangshan Hall?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nCost? Haha, surely you jest! We are honorable disciples of the Guhua Clan, and wish only to invite those of character to come visit. We are not brash, swindling charlatans!\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nI'm not even asking for a penny! How about it? Would you care to come with me for a tour, and together explore our clan's illustrious history?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Great, that's just what I was thinking!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, you certainly are direct!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Since it's free, we might as well go take a look...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHowever, Wangshan Hall is, in the end, very important to us. Custom dictates, therefore, that outsiders who wish to enter must first pass two trials.\nPut another way, we first wish to see just how skilled you are!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Hmph, don't underestimate us!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nOf course, of course! These two tests will certainly be a walk in the park for your illustrious selves!\nIt's just that these are the rules of our clan, and we can't simply change them arbitrarily. Please forgive me.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>This is so troublesome...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nHaha, no need to worry! These two tests will certainly be a walk in the park for your illustrious selves!\nIt's just that these are the rules of our clan, and we can't simply change them arbitrarily. Please forgive me.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nBoo... Nothing for it. Guess we've gotta do it for Guhua's treasure...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSo, what exactly do I need to do?\n<color=#ffffff>Huang the Third:</color>\nIt's very simple. Please, follow me!\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nStay safe, you two.\n<color=#ffffff73>Optional Dialogue:</color> Talk to Wen the Fourth\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Tell me about the trials...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nOutsiders who seek to enter Wangshan Hall must pass two trials. This rule has existed since ancient times.\nHowever... Forget it, if my senior thinks it's all right, then I have nothing to say about it. Anyway, there's nothing to worry about. Anyone can pass the trials as they are right now.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nHuh? What do you mean?\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\n...You will understand soon enough. Go on, don't let me keep you. My senior is waiting.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We'll be on our way then. Goodbye!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Wen the Fourth:</color>\nGo on, my senior is waiting."
