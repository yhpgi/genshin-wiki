What mattered was to roar, loud and clear, in the heat of bloody battle. That was duty fulfilled.\nSuch hot blood running through the veins should not have been conducive to a long history for the Imunlaukr Clan.\nFor their fight was one without end, and without hope of victory.\nAnd yet, as the snow slowly melted and Mondstadt began to take shape, gradually they realized: They had found something to fight for at last."
