At first, the many commands were only added to the circuits to aid in its smooth running, but it seems that all the superimposition and layering of orders onto one another has wound up creating a rudimentary artificial intelligence.",

As long as you learn how to use such a machine, you could build a city colossal beyond imagination, even within extreme environments like the depths of a volcano.<br>In addition, it also seems to be able to be used as a weapon. Though the ancient civilization has long since fallen, this machine, shaped like a giant claw and powered by the golden designs engraved on it, can still engage in battle based upon its preset instructions.",
