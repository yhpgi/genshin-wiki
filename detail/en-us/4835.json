  "desc": "<p>A gift from Kuki Shinobu after helping the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King power up and find new ways in Beetle Battle in Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp.</p><p>Dried ramen blocks are placed in a sturdy yet light box, with sealed condiments, exceptionally rigid utensils, and a bowl. Put the ramen and the condiments in the bowl, then pour in hot water to quickly make a bowl of ramen that doesn't taste too bad at all. Convenient, isn't it?</p><p>But according to the letter that Kuki Shinobu left in the box, neither she nor Arataki Itto got to eat this during their journey on the water to Liyue, because they only brought cookies and pickles. During their stay in Liyue, Kuki Shinobu was inspired by the wheaten foods there, and created this instant ramen so that Oni King's Right Hand and Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon could fight off their hunger during their travels...</p>",
