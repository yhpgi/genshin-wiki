During the Archon War, Mountain Shaper was summoned by the Lord of Geo to protect Liyue.\nCurrently, he lives in Jueyun Karst, his abode is located on Mt. Hulao, and his power stems from both inner enlightenment and external knowledge. The way to the abode is obstructed by amber traps, which careless travelers often fall into. The amber is produced by a flower that one has planted here, called the karst crawler. The majority of the plant is hidden underground. When stepped on, it produces amber to trap the invader. After taking up residence here, Mountain Shaper planted many karst crawlers to ensure that the tranquility of the mountain would remain undisturbed. Once, seeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper sealed Qiqi, a maiden who was accidentally killed during the Adepti war. She was awakened later, but went into a berserk state, being unable to control Adeptal energy running in her, so the amber trap seemed the only solution. After hundreds of years, Qiqi was discovered by humans, still trapped in the amber, and was brought to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for burial. The mountain roads were treacherous, however, and the amber was bumped about. Coupled with the passing of many years, the seal on Qiqi was all but spent. She awakened in the middle of the night, broke the amber in secret, and fled."

Together they defeated Osial and sent him back beneath the Guyun Stone Forest. Through the discussions, Adepti agreed to let the Liyue Qixing rule the nation."

Mountain Shaper said he had once come to the harbor to collect karst crawlers' seeds, and the young people of Liyue were pestering him. In the end, Streetward Rambler had to save her friend. He also said that he borrows a cooking machine from Cloud Retainer and cooks food, hiding the machine whenever he sees the Adepti.\nDuring Cloud Retainer's kite-flying master class on Mt. Aocang, the Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper were flying a kite on a nearby mountain. The kite accidentally ended up on Mt. Aocang, and they had to meet Cloud Retainer, who immediately recognized them as old friends. Later, the Adepti participated in Cloud Retainer's plan to help a young man from Chenyu Vale, Gaming, reunite with his father. They pretended to be the Treasure Hoarders and distracted Gaming while the Traveler and Paimon followed the plan and took Gaming's father away."

And if Menogias, as before, did not dare to get involved in human affairs, he could have entrusted the sale of kites to them.
