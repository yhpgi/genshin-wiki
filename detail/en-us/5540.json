Hold on, could this be the actual \"Guhua Treasure Chamber\" recorded in the legends?\nAlso, Traveler, look over there! Paimon spies something glowing on that platform!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It must be treasure!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Could it be a... mechanism?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAnyway, let's go check it out right away!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Investigate the mechanism</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Engraved Inscription:</color>\n\"...The heavens are unfaithful, and those who seek its blessing and gain audience are rare.

Wait, those Guhua people didn't really create twelve identical mechanisms, did they!?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Investigate the Ancient Sword</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? This sword seems to have something written on it. Let Paimon see...\n<color=#ffffff>Ancient Swordsman's Inscriptions:</color>\n\"...Caressing the blade, singing I go, to cleave dragons and drink their blood. The divine light like flowing lightning, the icy edge threatens to smash the mountains...\"\n\"...Beneath Mt. Tianheng, I slay tigers, the scaled beast I skewer amidst the Sea of Clouds...

The handwriting below seems to be different...\n<color=#ffffff>Ancient Swordsman's Inscriptions:</color>\n\"...I originally wanted to leave behind some delicacies here. But the food would inevitably spoil over time, so I left the recipes here for you to cook instead. I assure you, they shall be delicious indeed.\"\n\"...Apart from these, nothing else remains. Only this sword and the beautiful scenery.\"\n\"...When faced with a dead end, what should we do? You already know the answer.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Crooked Engraving:</color>\n\"...Do not take... treasure, leaving solely one... henceforth...\"\nMay my final stand... be a monument...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa...
