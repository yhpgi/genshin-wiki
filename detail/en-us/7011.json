Though it does make sense, after all, you must've spent a lot of time here before you met us...\nPaimon wonders if those glowing pillars will disappear after we leave this time... Still, let's clean up a bit first, then rest for a while!\n<color=#ffffff>You, Little One, and Paimon tidy up the place together.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, now it's looking pretty good!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm, you're pretty excited, aren't 'cha, Little One? Do you have something you wanna tell us?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nWrroh... Rrrawr...\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? Do you want us to turn around?\nYou didn't prepare a surprise for us, did you? Heehee, you're as easy to read as an open book!\nAlright, then, we'll play along!\n<color=#ffffff>You and Paimon turn around, and all you can hear is the continuous clinking and jingling.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>It sounds like Little One is tinkering with something...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>After a short while, Little One lets out a \"Rawr rawr!\". It's probably time to turn back around...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, that's a lot of stuff!\nLet Paimon have a look! Let's see, a super straight branch, a really round rock... And some strange food with a weird color and smell. Well, that's probably been left out for who knows how many days...\nYou carefully selected and collected all these, didn't you? Are they gifts for us?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nStill, we can't eat food that's been left out for too long! Whoever eats it — and that includes you — would get an upset stomach! So we've gotta deal with that first...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nArroooo... Rooooawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>But this branch is really something!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah! It feels like it'd be every bit as impressive as a master sword when you wave it around!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>This rock is really round!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAnd it's shiny, too! Hehe, we've crossed a lotta rivers, and we've seen lots of round rocks, so you can believe us when we say this stone is a gem amongst rocks!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nMmmhmm, we'll happily take it all! Hehe, just put it all in Paimon's secret stash's backpack pouch! Maybe they'll come in handy someday!\nHmm, since Little One gave us a gift, we should give him a gift in return.\nLet Paimon see what she's got in her secret stash...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Wow. Your seldom-seen generous side makes an appearance...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nLittle One went out of his way to show us how much he cares, that's not something to take lightly! Also, if it gets too heavy, Paimon can't really fly, so maybe Paimon can give him some...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Just what have you squirreled away, Paimon?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nPaimon said it's her secret, private stash! Even if we're the bestest of buddies, that's not something Paimon can just tell you, you know! Anyway, there's plenty enough to give Little One a gift!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTa-da! It's a super shiny gem! Do you like it, Little One?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOoh! Guess Paimon's picked just the thing, huh? Hey, be careful now! Don't drop it...\n...Oh boy. Why does Paimon feel like you'll lose the gem if you hold onto it like that...?\nWhy don't we go find the Children of Echoes? If anyone's got gemsmiths who could shape it for us, it'd be them!\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Little One\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>How are you feeling today?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, Little One sure looks like he's in a good mood!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Touch his horn...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRooarr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nLet Paimon touch too! Hehe, don't wiggle, you're tickling Paimon's palm...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>About the golden designs...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmmm... The golden designs you speak of are probably those \"Iridescent Inscriptions\"...\nThough sometimes, Paimon can't see them where you say they are...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nGrrooooah? Wrrrooo...?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo need for you to start \"wrooing\", it's better not to see some things...\nLittle One and Traveler, you two be careful, okay?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Look for a jeweler's shop in the Children of Echoes</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Speak to the apprentice at the shop</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nWelcome to our shop! If you'd like us to cut a gemstone, you're in the right place!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey there! We do have a gemstone here, and we'd like to have it custom-processed. It's for our little Tepetlisaurus companion, ta-da! Here it is—\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nWow! This gem is of truly exceptional quality! Look at the size, and how clear it is... If you'd like a custom job, the processing will be quite difficult...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNow that sounds familiar. So what's next, extra fees?\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nNo! Of course not! Just what kind of person do you think I am!?\nOur shop specializes in the art of cutting and polishing gemstones. If we run into a good one, we'd rather polish it for free, and let its beauty speak for our quality as it carries our name out into the world. We'd never set high prices willy-nilly!\nBut just as a good artisan seeks the best materials to work with, so do the best gemstones require a suitable artisan to work them. I know just such a \"Gem Master,\" and he would be perfect for doing this one justice!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, that's amazing! Quick, call the Gem Master out!\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nAha, but you might need to make an appointment in advance if you'd like to see him. If you don't, chances are he'll be out seeking inspiration...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSeeking inspiration?\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nYeah! Master Kulahaw is pretty unusual even among master craftsmen. He doesn't believe that artisans should just polish a gemstone according to blueprints, but that they should understand how to observe all the beauty the natural world has to offer.\nFor example, learning polishing techniques from the tiny ripples on a lake's surface, or fretwork patterns from the shifting and billowing clouds... he calls it gathering inspiration!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh... Sounds kinda complicated...\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nStill, if you're in a hurry, you can go out and find him wherever he happens to be gathering inspiration from! Let me mark where he said he was going for you.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Look for the jeweler at the place he's gathering inspiration</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Speak with the Gem Master</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nExcuse me... Um, are you Master Kulahaw?\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nThat is, in fact, my name...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, so you're the Gem Master who is looking for inspiration! We came looking for you based on Imix's recommendation. We noticed you were staring at the tree just now. Were you in the middle of mining for gems of creativity?\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nUh, actually... Forget it. It's not important anymore... *sigh* Is there something I can help you with?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWe've brought a beautiful gemstone, and we were hoping you'd process it for Little One!\nHehe, c'mon, Little One, show him!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr—\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEhhh!?\n<color=#ffffff>You hear the fluttering of avian wings by your ears...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>By the time you recover, the gem has vanished from Little One's claws without a trace.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRaaaaah! Roaaaargh!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWha— Waitasec, where's the gem? Where could such a huge gem have gone off to?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSeems like a bird nicked it...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat the heck? The birds here steal stuff? Rude!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRoooawr! Rooooawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nActually, what I was about to say was, even if the gem hadn't just been stolen, I still couldn't help you cut it...\n...Since all my tools were also stolen by those damn birds! I was actually just carefully looking at those birds, going over them one by one, to see which one of them had their dirty claws on my tools.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIs... Is that even possible? These birds are just the worst! C'mon, Traveler, let's go get that gem back!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nAnd don't forget about my tools too—\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Kulahaw\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nThey're all perched up there on the tree... Could they be planning to build a nest with my tools?\nMy brave friends, it's all up to you! Ah, the pain of being without the means to earn my own bread...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Retrieve the lost gem and the tools</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Report back to the Gem Master</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nCan this be!? My tools are back! Oh, this is amazing!\nI didn't get a good look before, but I must say, now that's one pretty gem! It's got the same fleshy yellow as a bird's tarsus... Bah! I shan't use those blasted scoundrels in my analogies.\nLike the sky just brightening at dawn, like the first rays of the sun, that kind of early morning sky color... Yeah, that's a good description...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>For a master, your metaphors aren't very masterful...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nHey, I'm no storyteller! Really, all I need to do is remember the beautiful colors of nature... Using pretty words to describe them isn't my forte.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>So that's the meaning of \"gathering inspiration\"?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nOh? So you've heard of the practice before?\n<color=#ffffff>Kulahaw:</color>\nEither way, just leave the gem to me. As I said before, I'll process it for free. Consider it a gift for your help in retrieving my tools. As for how long it'll take... Drop by the Gemporium in two days' time!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Wait until two days later</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Go to the gemporium to retrieve the gem</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nAh, you're here. Master Kulahaw has already left your processed gem in the shop, leaving instructions that I personally deliver it to you.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? Master Kulahaw isn't here today either?\n<color=#ffffff>Imix:</color>\nThat's right, he's out gathering inspiration yet again. By the way, he also made a set of locks to carry with him, saying it was to prevent his tools from being stolen... Which is weird... Would anyone want to steal our cutting tools and sell them?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOf course they wouldn't! It's becau—\n(...So Imix still doesn't know they were stolen by birds... Let's spare Kulahaw the embarrassment!)\nBecause... Because there's someone who thinks they can steal his skills that way too, haha...\nForget it... Anyway, we'll take the gem!
