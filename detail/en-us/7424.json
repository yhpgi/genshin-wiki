Over the centuries, the finest adventurers have tried to prove themselves by venturing in... Sadly, most ended up perishing there.\n<color=#37ffff>Citlali</color> : That lasted up until around twenty or thirty years ago, when strange things started happening. People started speaking of an enormous, dark creature the size of a mountain roaming inside the Mare Jivari...\n<color=#37ffff>Citlali</color> : And then, shortly after that, the whole region just completely disappeared. Nobody knows how, but that infamously ominous place just vanished from the face of the world.\n<color=#37ffff>Paimon</color> : What!? How the heck!?\n<color=#37ffff>Citlali</color> : I know, right? Anyway, if I'm not mistaken, the place indicated on this map is where it used to be before it disappeared.\n<color=#37ffff>Paimon</color> : And where is that?\n<color=#37ffff>Citlali</color> : At the westernmost part of Natlan. It's a very remote location, far away from any of the tribes. There never used to be a settlement there, but there's been more people since the Mare Jivari disappeared."
