You dare disturb my royal slumber!?\"\nSundjatta saw that the vile dragon of legend had long become doddering and deranged,\nThat it would claim a Sovereign's title while forgetting its race.\nSo he burst into laughter, hoisting his massive hammer, and mocked the enfeebled drake:\n\"I am merely a nameless miner, not some contemptible knave.\"\n\"Just as you are no king — merely a tottering lizard!\"\nRage surged in Lukwata's throat upon hearing these words, and with more wild retching,\nIt spat forth filthy, scorching lava, billowing forth plumes of pitch-black smoke,\nAt which Sundjatta did not even frown, instead swinging his heavy hammer down on the old drake.\nOld and infirm was Lukwata, yet when enraged it remained terrifyingly formidable,\nAnd as the great heat of the magma scorched Sundjatta's hair and eyebrows,\nThe dragon's fierce venom again seeped into flesh and viscera, the unbearable agony burning deep,\nAnd its massive yellowed fangs left festering wounds, while sharpened claws tore open old scars.\nYet on and on Sundjatta swung, enduring tremendous pain,\nUntil the dragon's craggy head split open, until the hammer-storm blew the black smog away.\nAnd when the elder dragon's soul had been scattered to the winds, and the magma lake had cooled by half,\nSundjatta lay down, contented — truly now did he deserve a hero's name!"
