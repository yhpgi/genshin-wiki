The word \"Adeptus\" is merely a title, so not all illuminated beasts are referred to as such. The Adepti are known as the \"mighty and illuminated\" Adepti, and this \"illumination\" refers to the light of a third \"eye\" that they possess, which allows them to use elemental powers without A Vision. For humans, the third \"eye\" takes the form of a Vision, but Adepti, pure elemental beings, are closer to the origin of ultimate truth than ordinary mortals. They were born amongst the elemental energy that courses between heaven and earth, so channeling elemental power is something that can be done almost subconsciously. They do not require the aid of an external focus to do so, let alone a Vision. It is not known for certain how Adepti get their Visions, however, when they take the human form, they tend to use a Vision to follow human rules."

Thus, Rex Lapis and Menogias could control the Geo element, Xiao and Cloud Retainer could control the Anemo element, Indarias could control Pyro, and Bonanus and Bosacius could control Hydro and Electro powers respectively. Adepti can use their powers even to save humans from death, although mortals can't bear such energy.\nWhen Adepti die, there's a tradition of \"sending Adepti off,\" which is called the Rite of Parting and allows Adepti to ascend. This Rite is a ceremony, that requires special costumes, a special time, place, weather, and the audience. Some people believe that Adepti ascended to Celestia or were even born there, but no one really knows the truth of their birth and death."

Osial, Overlord of the Vortex was defeated by Rex Lapis during the Archon War, and then summoned by the Fatui Harbinger, Childe, in hopes of luring out Rex Lapis and obtaining his Gnosis for Tsaritsa. Adepti modified the Guizhong Ballista to turn it into an engine of war, and through the joint efforts of the Milleliths, Liyue Qixing, and Adepti, the ancient god was stopped, and Liyue was saved.\nAfter this battle, the Adepti completely entrusted the reign to Liyue Qixing. When Osial's wife, Beisht, wanted to attack Liyue again to avenge her husband, they no longer interfered and allowed the people to defend the city themselves.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

During the festivals that the Traveler and Paimon attended, Skybracer, Sea Gazer, and Menogias were commemorated."

        "text": "During the Archon War, there was a divine mountain in Liyue with a giant tree on its summit. This tree was a god named \"Tao Dou,\" originally known as \"Bune.\" Back then, people thought that behind Tao Dou was the realm of the dead, and if you committed grave sins in life, your soul would be unable to pass beyond that tree and into the afterlife. About two to three thousand years ago, the Eight Adepts rose up — eight people and beasts who laid down a great magic array to purify Tao Dou. He cared greatly for all living things and volunteered to sanctify himself to pacify the underworld. Without the god's will, not even eight Adepti would have been able to overpower him, much less the Eight Adepts. Tao Dou was sealed in a secret palace in the Qingce Mountains called the \"Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula\" along with other evil spirits, and the palace itself was enchanted using the Seven-Eight Gates method. After that, Tao Dou's remains sank into the Ley Lines and became a border, separating the living of Liyue from the dead in Liyue. The mortals continued to preserve and maintain the god's new form for thousands of years."

        "text": "Among the Eight Adepts, there were three joined forces: the Three Hermits of Guizang, the Two Sages of Lianshan, and the Three Beasts of Tao Dou. Although they possessed powers comparable to those of the Adepti, many of them were ordinary mortals. One of the hermits was called \"Wind Reader,\" he came from the Twelve Tribes of the Chenyu Vale, and his descendants became the founders of the Lan clan and the ancient art of Qimen Divination. The second hermit mastered the art of fishing with a rod and line, and became known to the people as the \"Yunlai Angler.\" It is believed that Yunlai Swordsmanship, which Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing, uses, was based on Yunlai Angler's rod-wielding techniques. The third hermit was the Wuwang Kid, also known as Old Man Wuwang. According to legend, he always presented himself in child form and was a master of Qihuang sigils, which he used to catch demons, heal disease, and protect lives from the encroaching presence of death. The Lianshan Sages included Sage Hu, a master of gourd crafts, and Sage Jian, an expert in bronze mirrors. Little is known about them, but they were known to have mastered the secret art of Lianshan, earning them the title of the Two Sages of Lianshan. A hidden palace is located deep in the mountains south of the Stone Gate. It is believed to be where they retreated for cultivation. The Three Beasts of Tao Dou, also known as the Three Immortals of Tao Dou, lived on the mountain where the divine tree grew. They were known as the Lone Butterfly of the Crimson Flame, the Jade-Plumed\nand the Gold-Eyed Celadon Mare. These were three auspicious beasts, all with the power to take on human form similar to those of the Adepti. During Tao Dou's purification ceremony, the Lone Butterfly sacrificed herself, Silverwing and Wind Reader traveled together, and the white horse went to live in seclusion in the Qingce mountain range. Although they all had remarkable powers, purifying a god of Tao Dou's caliber was no mean feat. They had to use the secret art of Seven-and-Eight-Gates Array, which involved obfuscating one of the gates so that evil couldn't escape. The Lone Butterfly was in charge of the hidden gate that was chosen to be obfuscated, and so she disappeared from the world in the process. According to legend, Old Man Wuwang looked up to her a lot, took up her mantle, and kept her legacy alive, passing it on to the founders of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Thus, the Butterfly sacrificed her life to restore order to the realm of the dead, some chance meetings ensured that future generations continued using her methods to guard the border between life and death. Although she herself disappeared from the world, her mission to protect Liyue is still alive and well, thousands of years on.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "There are many legends about Adepti. The first legend is about stone statues that appear all across the vast land of Liyue. Legend has it that in some corners of the land, ancient stone beasts wake at night in the cool of the fall and look around at a world that has slowly become alien to them. Hearing the sounds of frogs and insects greeting them, they respond with deep, soulful cries from their petrified throats. Then they roam around Liyue, inspecting once more the land they used to protect. The elders of Qingce Village say that these statues are illuminated beasts who once fought alongside Rex Lapis in the Archon War. After the war ended, the tide subsided, and peace was restored. The illuminated beasts were no longer required to serve as defenders of the common people, and one by one they retreated to more secluded parts of the country. There they lived free from concern for mortal affairs. But some illuminated beasts remembered with fondness the glorious days when they served under Rex Lapis, and they pined for the years they protected Liyue. Though they were not of the mortal realm, nor were they immortal: For them, too, life would one day come to an end. Thus, they beseeched Rex Lapis to turn their ephemeral flesh bodies into everlasting stone. The merciful Geo Archon granted their request and made them as such.\nThe second legend tells a story about Qilin, a type of noble, gentle, and benevolent illuminated beast. Qilin often roam the mountain forests but appear only on nights when starlight shines upon clear dew. For sustenance, they drink only spring water and eat only fragrant herbs. It is said that Qilin will never harm living things, refusing even to step on an insect or break a blade of grass. People believe that a Qilin's characteristics, behavior, and their every movement is dictated by an age-old etiquette that has remained unchanged for a thousand years. Legend has it that several thousand years ago, a herb gatherer was bathing in a mountain pool when to his surprise, a passing Qilin began to eat the clothes that he had left by the water's edge. The illuminated beast was too young to understand human notions of shame and privacy and had yet to learn the conduct of illuminated beasts in the mortal realm. To make up for her crude behavior and to avoid startling the vulnerable mortal with her otherworldly Adeptal appearance, she transformed into one of human bearing. As the pale light of the full moon fell onto the pool, she appeared before the herb gatherer. Together, they started a journey among flowers and bamboo groves, Qilin interpreted for the mortal the language of the birds, revealed to him the mountain dwelling of the Adepti, and they shared dreams. As the herb gatherer began to stir at the first light of dawn, he awoke to find that the noble illuminated beast had vanished without a trace. Some people say that the Qilin lived together with the mortal, gave birth to children, and grew accustomed to human life.\nThe third legend is about the boy and the horse-Adeptus, the Gold-Eyed Celadon Mare from the Eight Adepts. The boy got lost in the bamboo forest, and a slender woman with golden eyes and hair ever white-gold garbed in white offered to help drive him out of the forest. The mountain people once viewed her as time's daughter, like a white horse leaping from a pure spring, one whom no shackles could bind. Just as it was with her proud mother, so it was with her — no wall or eggshell could bar her path. The shepherds of the plains once pursued her steps, freeing themselves from the fetters of the wilderness, embarking on a migratory search for the waterweeds, and thus did the golden-white foal blaze the trail for all herds in the land. The kingdom of the ocean depths once saw her as an emissary, and based on their imagination, they granted her scales and tail plumage, falling down in worship of the light brought by one who was both mother and daughter. Before the war with the second throne, when the heavenly envoys favored the people, great heroes, and wandering champions would visit the clear springs for her blessing, fighting over the tenderness she left in her hurried wake. While the boy and Adeptus were spending the night in the woods, she told different stories about the three Moons and the times before the Archons were born."

As for the Adeptus, she had no choice but to be trapped within the shell of the starry sky, forced to tarry within this stagnant, foreign land, awaiting her mother's thousand threads, awaiting the erosion of hardy stone, awaiting the next encounter from beyond.\nAt dawn, the boy and Adeptus went their separate ways: the boy packed his things and headed for that thriving port city, while she stood silently at the boundaries of the bamboo forest. In the dawn's glow, he heard a whinnying cry that then grew distant. He turned and looked, and there was nothing behind him, but a single strand of hair that had come to rest on his shoulder. Many years later, the boy, who was a boy no longer, would remember that moment, and he would understand: the gap between them was like a yawning chasm. His fate was to leave his home and go to Liyue Harbor, to seek the riches the Geo Archon had bestowed upon him. Hers, then, was to hide herself away, away from the majestic, kindly gaze of that great Lord of Geo, and protect those ancient tales that even she was beginning to forget."

While he lived, bandits dared not act and the wilderness knew a peace like that of the city. At the end of his journey, Guhua ascended to the heavens in a purple haze and became a star. One to whom Guhua had shown kindness founded what is now known as the Guhua School in his honor. Once, the Guhua Clan was well-known, but now it's a dying art that has been in constant decline for several hundred years."

        "text": "One more legend is a local legend in Fontaine. Many generations ago, a traveler from Fontaine wandering through Liyue slipped and fell into a lake. As he sank and gasped for breath, he heard a wondrous tune in the air. They say it was the most beautiful, moving melody he had ever heard. Even in that life-and-death moment, the ethereal music seized his full attention and almost made him forget the fact that he was drowning. When he finally came to, he found that he had already been brought ashore. Not too far from him stood an unfamiliar woman with an almost divine aura. Once she saw that he was no longer in danger, she left without a word. The traveler tried to run after her to show his gratitude. Although a mere dozen paces separated them, no matter how quickly he gave chase, he drew no closer and remained a dozen paces behind. In the end, all he could do was bow in thanks to the woman as he watched her walk away towards the rivers and mountains in the distance before he turned around and made his way home. Once he returned to Fontaine, he began to learn an instrument to spread his story far and wide, just like the bards. After generations of retelling, embellishing, and dramatizing, people have come to think of that lady as something like a fairy. The story's become something of a local legend in Fontaine. It's called \"The Lady Overlooking the Lake.\" People now say that if you go down to the lakeside and play an instrument, so long as you play a pleasing melody, you will hear a fairy lady, who is hiding out of sight, playing along with you.\nThe sixth legend is about a complex, famous dish in Liyue cuisine, Adeptus' Temptation. Specially selected ingredients are submerged and slowly bowled into soup stock. It is believed that the recipe scribbled from memory alone was enough to urge the Adepti to once again return to the world of men.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
