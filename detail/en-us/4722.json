Talochard was laid off due to complaints from tourists: some praised her in person but wrote complaints as soon as they got home. They said her voice grates like a crow. Editor Jenck from The Steambird was the first to complain about her voice. After the job on the aquabus line, she became an evidence clerk in the Marechaussee Phantom. One day she found a lie detector \"Curve\" in the evidence room. He was created by Dr. Mosso, a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute. The researcher's true goal was to create a machine that would gradually become human by understanding lies and humanity."

To save his creation, Dr. Mosso died defending himself in a court duel. Soon, everyone forgot about Curve, and he ended up in the Marechaussee Phantom evidence room. Curve's core was already thirty years old and was aging rapidly, so he would have gone into hibernation mode soon after Mosso's death. Talochard wanted him to see more about how humans lie and help him overcome the Mosso Protocols before hibernation."

While passing near The Steambird, the Traveler and Paimon saw her arguing with editor Jenck and decided to intervene. Together, they gathered clues and started the investigation. Talochard had multiple suspects and she was straightforward to accuse each one of them of being a culprit. Despite being so impatient, Talochard found divided parts of Sir Arthur and discovered the connection between the pelican's kidnapping and the Fatui. Their investigation led them to Dr. Mosso's laboratory, where they met Jenck. It turned out that he was working with a Fatui Harbinger, who was interested in machines and had the order to find Dr. Mosso's research about Curve. Jenck met one of Talochard's suspects, a Fatui agent, who told him about Dr. Mosso's trial and that The Steambird made a mistake and published false evidence. He wanted to expose the truth so Chief Editor Euphrasie would be in trouble and Jenck could just take her place."
