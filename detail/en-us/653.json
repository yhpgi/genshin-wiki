Those who submit to her, those things she conquers, those who love her — they're all the same to her. People who can't hurt her in an imperial succession battle.\"\n\"Huh. No wonder those Andromeda Empire assassins kidnapped her. Two birds with one stone, eh?\"\n\"I'm not getting involved in their succession wars.
