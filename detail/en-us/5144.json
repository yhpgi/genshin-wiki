Balent took matters into his own hands, as the Fortress's pipeline breakdown and the emergency threatened serious consequences. During the previous inspection, he had found some damage and filed a request, but nothing had been delivered yet. Since there was no time to delay the pipeline maintenance work, he went to the Hilichurl camp alone and was captured. The Traveler and Paimon were alarmed at the possibility of Balent being in danger and wanted to rescue him. However, Aigouy believed that learning through personal experience was crucial for Balent to grow. Despite Aigouy's objections, Paimon and the Traveler proceeded to rescue Balent and aided him in repairing the Fortress of Meropide's piping."

This was Lanoire's first glimpse of the outside world. She compared the continent of Teyvat to the Fortress of Meropide, assuming Teyvat must be enormous since she couldn't see any walls. Estienne wanted to let Lanoire go, and the group planned to find Lanoire's family, but another guard from the Fortress of Meropide, Noailles, confronted them, questioning their intentions and their presence with Lanoire. Estienne defended their actions, claiming he was correcting the mistake of Lanoire and Caterpillar's imprisonment due to missing paperwork. However, Noailles insisted they were still criminals. When he saw the real appearance of Caterpillar — a Hilichurl — he considered him a monster and wanted to destroy him and lock the rest in prison. Thanks to the help of Estienne and another guard, Lanoire and Caterpillar managed to leave the Fortress through the shaft of the Geode Mine, and Lanoire went to live with her grandfather, Earnshaw, who did not even know about her existence."

This cream used illegal components and could be dangerous for people. The Maison Gardiennage found it while investigating the escape from the Fortress of Meropide. Eventually, all criminals involved in this illegal production were arrested.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Edwin Eastinghouse is a former Senior Technician who conducted experiments using Arkhium to defy gravity with the hopes of lifting the Court of Fontaine into the sky as a means to avoid the prophesied flood. His experiments were believed to be the cause of the massive explosion that destroyed most of the Fontaine Research Institute. After the explosion, the institute had to regroup and establish a new facility adjacent to the remnants of the old ruins, preserving what remained intact after the explosion. The operational institute now goes by the name \"New Fontaine Research Institute.\" The Fontaine Research Institute Administrative Officers, Choiseul and Raimondo, are also located here. Raimondo and Choiseul share the heavy responsibilities that belong to the post of Director. Raimondo is responsible for getting scientific work and research back on track, and Choiseul is responsible for everything apart from that. Their main goal remains the same — to rebuild the Fontaine Research Institute and work hard for the well-being of all the people of the Court of Fontaine."

They will usually come to the Institute Dormitories to play piano, read, and have a drink or two if necessary. The dormitories of the Institute do not have beds. According to the researcher Nacker, sleeping is a waste of time, and most other researchers feel the same way. Even when it seems like they're taking a break, they're still pondering different academic subjects subconsciously. It's akin to a vast ocean that, while appearing calm on the surface, still has a strong undercurrent beneath. Sometimes, the undercurrents below are much stronger than the towering waves above.\nOnce, the Traveler and Paimon were accompanied by Chronie, a journalist, and Nacker, to the new Fontaine Research Institute and met with co-administrators Raimondo and Choiseul. They escorted Nacker to complete a task located at the Institute Dormitories. Chronie questioned whether this was truly where researchers should spend their downtime and found the conditions to be inhumane and suggested prioritizing the renovation of this place. Although this location was not as impacted by the explosion, Nacker agreed this space urgently required renovations and had a severely limited power supply.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Consequently, he was dismissed from his post as Senior Technician effective immediately, with further investigation pending. Like Edwin Eastinghouse, Coutrot, who also went by the name Kuisel, was dismissed from his position by the Institute.

The Arkhium in the device's core has the characteristics of \"splitting\" or \"precipitation,\" and can take matter, or certain things outside of matter, and separate them. Initial estimates indicated that the device could lift an entire block of buildings. While conducting research, the Arkhium core within the field generator overloaded, triggering a colossal explosion that laid waste to the institute of which Edwin Eastinghouse is given the blame. Consequently, the Experimental Field Generator lost control and now occupies this area of the institute. The explosion claimed the lives of several researchers and many of those who escaped unharmed chose to leave the institute. A mysterious green-yellow crystalline ore that is mutually attracted to others like it can be found at the top level of the ruins by the \"Prototype Cal. Breguet.\"\nThe Institute is planning to rebuild, which requires certain resources and personnel arrangements to be managed through the Maison Gestion. They took this matter seriously and Roialte, Gestionnaire of the Maison Gestion, selected a team to conduct field studies in the vicinity. While Mr. Roialte stayed behind at the Maison Gestion to handle the head count, Iaune was tasked with visiting the Institute to take pictures of certain locations in order to coordinate the reception. The Institute had a letter for the Maison Gestion and Iaune thought to bring it back with him. Mr. Choiseul insisted this would violate proper procedure and refused to hand it over as letters need to be \"traceable.\" As for the Academic Assembly Hall, while the structure resembles a hall, its academic relevance was questionable. Iaune observed the building, finding it relatively intact but too high for a reception to coordinate the plans to rebuild the institute."

Natural philosophers suggest the pine forest's name originates from a barbarian tribe named Dryas, offering a less romanticized explanation than the one offered in the ancient Fontainian play \"Dryas.\" This play honors Aurelius, a hero who conquered many nations for Fontaine, who is believed to be a fictitious invention since historical records do not correspond to his existence. Legends tell of Aurelius falling into an enemy trap during a campaign where he was saved by silver arrows just before an assassin's blade could strike. He met Dryastis, the young maiden who had saved him with her bow, and she began to plead for an end to the needless death in their land. Aurelius was moved by her plea and accepted the proffered bow from her hands and sounded the withdrawal, only to be slain en route by conniving traitors, his body consigned to the ocean depths. Over millennia, the tale has evolved with various versions depicting Aurelius's tragic fate or obsessive love for Dryastis. Regardless of his fate — whether drowned, slain by new adversaries, or transformed by time — the tale of Aurelius and Dryastis persists as a legend of turbulent times. Meanwhile, the bow that played a pivotal role in Aurelius's destiny found its way through many hands, eventually becoming a prop in children's theater — a separate tale of its own."

Calla Lily allowed them to defeat her, and as she was departing, Blanche offered her a copy of the \"Pure Water\" formula that Bulle Fruit recreated, which she graciously accepted.\nNot wanting his sister to become a Treasure Hoarder like him, Bulle Fruit willingly went to the Fortress of Meropide.

A secondary explosion, minor in comparison to the first, occurred at the ruins of the Central Laboratory, which dispersed numerous condensing components of the Arkhium inhibitor into the surrounding waters.

Throughout the Hilichurl camp, there are notes that detail how a project team developed the \"Comprehensive Combat Formula\" (CCF) by combining ancient fleet combat logic and adventurer combat data. The CCF set targets for the meka, such as acting as a vanguard, detecting and defeating monsters, engaging powerful enemies, overcoming obstacles, and destroying enemy strongholds. Nine prototypes were planned in three phases: Full System Prototype, Initial Operational Viability, and Full Operational Viability, with mass production to follow based on prototype data. Throughout this location, three gears, two Spur Gear C's and one Spur Gear T, can be found. Placing the gears onto the meka will reveal a hidden property of the machine where unlit fireworks spawn at the top, which can then be lit to display a brief fireworks show.

Within this secret vault, it is rumored that the Marechaussee Hunters of the past left behind a treasure capable of defeating any sorcerer.\nTo enter the cave where this vault is hidden, one must crack open a bit of rock, revealing a stretch of open water. After completing that puzzle mechanism connected to the vault door, you must prove yourself worthy of inheriting the secrets of the past. The reward for solving the puzzle is one of the Marechaussee Hunter keys, passed down through generations. Four keys in total are needed to form the final, complete key. Once the door is opened the treasure will be revealed: a stone tablet surrounded by weapons.\nThe silent tablet bears the names of the ancient Marechaussee Hunters and their heroic deeds inscribed upon it. The weapons surrounding the tablet, at first glance, appear absolutely ordinary, but a faint energy emanates from within. Though it's been a long time since they were used in battle, their edges remain sharp, as if they're simply waiting for the next worthy Hunter to carry on their legacy. The Marechaussee Hunters of ages past would often imbue their weapons with special enchantments to suppress monsters. Whenever a monster was nearby, their weapons would start to glow. If one recites the names of a Marechaussee Hunter while holding one of these weapons, the Marechaussee Hunter will be summoned forth. The will of that past Hunter will course through the wielder's being. It is a feeling of courage and determination – a silent vow passed down from generation to generation that says, \"eradicate the monsters no matter the cost.\" The contents of this room are the treasure spoken of, representing the true legacy left behind by the Hunters."

According to the game's plot, all of the heroes were Marechaussee Hunters who had to find the Hunters' treasure to defeat a powerful sorcerer. When they were near one of the locked doors outside the vault, the game master Clorinde realized that their adventure had gone beyond the game, as the real Marechaussee Hunters' vault was revealed before them. The piece of key they received after solving the puzzle was exactly the same as the key Clorinde's mentor had left. It turned out that they had been lured to this cave by another club member and the heir of the Marechaussee Hunters, Florian. His father was a Hunter and devoted his entire life to serving the cause, but in return, he received only poverty and suffering. Members of his family had been Marechaussee Hunters for generations, passing down not only the title and swordsmanship but also a seal the Marechaussee Hunters used to restrain the Devorator, hoping that in time a way would be found to defeat it. Florian's father instructed him to always watch over that seal and maintain it regularly since it was the most important duty of his clan. However, after his death, his son abandoned this duty. This seal was suppressing the Devorator — a dangerous opponent who was able to amplify the obsessions and desires in people's hearts, to the point where they overtook them entirely. When Florian finally decided to check the seal, the monster took over his consciousness. The anger over injustice in Florian's soul made him easy prey.\nFlorian lured Clorinde, Lyney, Furina, Navia, the Traveler, and Paimon into the secret treasury in order to destroy the Hunters and take the treasures that he believed were rightfully his. To open the vault, he lacked only one key out of four: one was given to him by his father, he stole the other, and took the third key from a Hunter. During the battle with Florian, Clorinde temporarily expelled the monster from his body. To fight the Devorator, Clorinde's friends decided to take the Hunters' weapons: Furina had Este's sword, and Lyney had Walter's bow. Navia used Clorinde's mentor's sword. To defeat the monster, Florian lured it into his body, and Clorinde, Navia, Furina, Lyney, the Traveler, and Paimon defeated it with the help of the Hunters' spirits.\nIn the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region world quests"

It stands as a testament to the relentless pursuit of knowledge and interplay between technology and energy power in Fontaine. When a flood was prophesied to destroy Fontaine, institute researchers shifted their efforts to safeguard the entire nation. With its vast energy potential and ability to break earthly constraints, a mysterious yellow-green ore named Arkhium was once considered the key to the gate of salvation. The Arkhium Kinetic Core is the fruit of Raimondo's joint research with Edwin Eastinghouse. They believed if they constantly injected the kinetic core with enough energy, it would easily allow the Experimental Field Generator, designed by Edwin Eastinghouse, to run at full power. After creating the core, they both realized they could barely find a way to keep injecting it with enough energy to keep it at maximum power. Coming across the giant Arkhium, and although it was always in an inert state, they were certain that this ore had unprecedented purity. Edwin and Raimondo had a disagreement due to Raimondo offering a more conservative proposal, when Edwin wanted to solve the problem quickly. The Arkhium core within the field generator overloaded and triggered a colossal explosion that laid waste to the institute. This event propelled substantial blocks of Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies and fragments of the institute into the atmosphere. After the explosion, Raimondo promptly led the disaster investigation and evaluation efforts. Edwin disappeared after the explosion and many believed him to be dead. However, he was dismissed from his post of Senior Technician with further investigation pending due to being absent from work for a long period without having submitted any application. As a result of the disaster, the institute was forced to recollect and build a new location near the old ruins while maintaining what was not destroyed in the explosion. The Institute currently in working order is referred to as the \"New Fontaine Research Institute.\" This large explosion caused the institute's Arkhium to fragment and eventually, a secondary explosion occurred at the ruins of the Central Laboratory.</color>"

The minor secondary explosion was the result of energy flow affecting a small portion of Arkhium in the ruins. The force of the explosion was enough to cause the condensing components of the Arkhium inhibitor to be dispersed into the surrounding waters which required a suppression device to avert further crisis. Nacker, a senior researcher who had previously worked with Eastinghouse, had triggered the small explosion in order to steal the Arkhium Kinetic Core. Nacker was able to escape the explosion amidst the chaos. Later, a special investigator named Fusilier was hired to take charge of the stolen Arkhium Kinetic Core case. The investigation led Fusilier to a residence that emitted residual energy readings all around. Fusilier broke the house lock when none other than the missing Edwin Eastinghouse was found inside. Edwin surreptitiously pointed out Nacker's current whereabouts to be around the Fort Charybdis Ruins. Nacker revealed he was working on a \"Field Generator\" and was attempting to synchronize it with the Arkhium Kinetic Core in hopes of being the greatest kinetic engineer ever. It came to light that Edwin Eastinghouse led the investigation against Nacker on purpose, and he encouraged Nacker to go back to the institute and repent. Edwin wanted to get back to his research and claimed he wasn't present when the core exploded. After Nacker and Edwin exchanged a few words, Fusilier stated both of them harmed the interests of the institute and as the special investigator of the Fontaine Research Institute, she demanded both be taken to the institute to be dealt with accordingly. Upon arrival at the institute, after enough time had passed for Edwin and Raimondo to exchange words, the Maison Gardiennage's personnel arrived and took both Nacker and Edwin to the Fortress of Meropide.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

To get rid of these shackles, Rawat decided to create a product that could transform the appearance, erase birthmarks and wrinkles, and give the skin radiance and shine. Rawat tested the product on himself, and his beautiful appearance convinced buyers of its effectiveness. The presentation was also attended by Sigewinne, a writer for \"Beautes en fleurs\" magazine, known under the pen name \"Romaritime Flower.\" She was one of the leading faces of the Fontaine Beauty Association, so her praise of the product caused a great stir, and within minutes Butterfly Dew was sold out. Thanks to their fame, the Traveler and Paimon, who were interested in the event, received two free samples of the cream. Sigewinne believed that the product could be improved and promised to make it more effective. On the same day, Rawat testified to the Marechaussee Phantom against a group of criminals using his research and disappearing without a trace.\nBecause of Rawat's statement, the Marechaussee Phantom arrested all the criminals and placed them in the Fortress of Meropide for interrogation, but on the same day, strange things began to happen in the Fortress. One of the prisoners saw his doppelganger, another had his face melted, and several more people, including a guard, said that they woke up in someone else's body. All the prisoners they mentioned in their testimony were due to be released on that day. Realizing that a crime was unfolding before Duke Wriothesley and the officers of the Marechaussee Phantom, they ordered the release of prisoners to be stopped, but some had already managed to be freed. Sigewinne assumed that a special potion was used to change their appearance, and went along with the officers, the Traveler, and Paimon to investigate."

Only criminals were willing to support his research, and so Potton began to become involved in Sinthe production. When he wanted out of the case, his accomplices gave his photograph to the Marechaussee Phantom officers so that Potton could not escape. Then he created a potion that changed his appearance and became Rawat. He first spent all the money on treating his mother, but no medicine could cure her, and she did not even recognize her son with a new appearance. Researchers from the Institute were Interested in working with Rawat, but he wouldn't allow them to use his patent. The woman, who rejected him earlier, told him about her feelings. Rawat decided not to give up the profitable business and continued making Butterfly Dew. The liquid from the dissolved Fontainians was supplied to him by Vacher, who was behind the serial disappearances of women and Sinthe business. Rawat changed his appearance to his real one so that his mother could bid him farewell before her death, but the officers then arrested him due to a warrant."
