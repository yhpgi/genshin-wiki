The Traveler, Lynette, and Freminet also sided with Lyney and began to duel with the Knave, however, they were no match for the Harbinger and they were defeated. Moved by their determination to spare the ''traitors,'' Arlecchino was willing to change the rules and allow Filliol and the others to leave if they wanted to.

Subsequently, Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet were dispatched to infiltrate the fortress and gather intelligence. The \"Father\" of their House, The Knave, instructed them to conduct an investigation into the secret the Fortress of Meropide was hiding. The House of the Hearth had been investigating for a very long time, trying to uncover the mystery, when all of their informants, including the ones that had infiltrated the guards, suddenly vanished. Additionally, Arlecchino had somehow managed to confirm that Focalors did not possess Hydro Gnosis. It was this information that led them to suspect that Fontaine's Gnosis might be in the Fortress of Meropide, and related to that \"secret.\" The Knave used the situation with Childe as a pretext to negotiate with two high-ranking officials in the Court of Fontaine. Childe was almost like a bargaining chip for her.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>During their investigation, Lyney uncovered the fact that the Fortress of Meropide has a \"forbidden zone\" which was confirmed by the guards. After some persuasion, the Duke of the Fortress, Wriothesley, agreed to escort the Traveler and Paimon into the forbidden zone. They arrived at one of the three giant isolation gates, where only Wriothesley was allowed inside. The concentration of the Primordial Sea in the waters surrounding the Fortress of Meropide had started to rise, and the \"forbidden zone\" contained a massive sluice gate that was holding back the Primordial Sea.</color>"

The people drove the criminals away like a wolf pack chasing away the banished. The criminals received no sympathy of any kind from the people. They were exiled to the desolate seaside, where they experienced only pain, struggle, and the bone-chilling cold. Some of them began to repent, and prayed to the Hydro Archon, asking if there was still anything left they could do to redeem themselves. Egeria took pity on them and said: <color=#ffffffd9>\"You may go guard my secret, deep underneath the waves.\"</color> And so, relying on the power of the Hydro Archon, they gathered underneath the sea and began to build a fortress. They became a community down there in the deeps, and over the years, helped it to thrive. As the number of exiles increased, more and more people joined the community. When the first group of exiles died, they left the yet-unfinished fortress to their successors. The Hydro Archon continued to lend her support, allowing the fortress and what it stood for to continue growing even larger. Before long, this dark underwater fortress became the sinners' only home. And with that, the people here stopped referring to the Fortress as a prison. They saw themselves as repenting sinners, who would regain their freedom once they had sufficiently redeemed themselves. As time went on, people also realized that the Fortress was a lonely place. Once they had gotten used to life here, they could no longer feel comfortable living in the overworld. Once they had finished serving their sentences, some people left, and some others chose to stay. They'd find some idle position, and let their withered souls fade away with the ancient secrets of the past. After many, many centuries, only a few people still remember the reason for the Fortress' founding. Now, they only perceive it as an integral pillar of Fontainian society, a gathering place for exile."

Additionally, the Fortress is currently the largest manufacturer of Fontaine's clockwork meka. The upper level of the Fortress of Meropide has a canal through which prisoners are transported from the Opera Epiclese.\nThe main currency of the Fortress are Credit Coupons. As part of an experiment, they were created to prohibit the power of the Gods to intervene or embellish the power of the wealthy before the poor. Credit Coupons can fulfill desires, grant power, and even alter destiny. Inside the fortress, everyone is given a chance at a fresh start, regardless of their previous wealth or status.\nThe prison occupies a large area of underwater space in the Liffey Region. The prison has special searchlights that monitor fugitives. If they lingered near these searchlights for too long, they could end up in the Fortress themselves. There is a complex system of metal pipes that must be periodically maintained. A young Fortress worker, Balent, provided a routine inspection which revealed that the spares were defective. Although he applied for new ones, they hadn't been delivered yet, so he decided to do the maintenance of pipelines himself and was captured by hilichurls. With the Traveler's help, the gas leak in the pipes was stopped and Balent was saved.\nIn the Fortress of Meropide subarea, World Quests"

The duel happened to be scheduled on Wriothesley's release date, and as the administrator was nowhere to be found, there was no one available to sign his exit papers.

Dougier was the head and founder of the Beret Society, who stated his mission was to help everyone turn over a new leaf, so they would no longer have to lead such gloomy existences. Wriothesley approved Dougier's application for the organization believing it to be a group filled with model prisoners and a great place for those who wish to turn things around. The society members wore berets as a visible identifier and symbol of community pride. Dougier believed that if the members felt joy and pride from being a part of the group, then the hats would become a point of pride for them as well. The berets represented everything the group was believed to work toward— optimism, community, hard work, and the desire to create a new life. The berets also served to symbolize \"model citizens\" and help recruit new members. With subtle hints, Wriothesley quickly realized that something was off about the Beret Society. After some investigation, it was found that the berets concealed a thorn filled with Aqua Doloris, a dark liquid that induced fear when injected into members' brains. Dougier punished and tortured those who broke society's true rules with this liquid. Breaking a rule resulted in \"censure,\" where the thorn injected Aqua Doloris into the member's head, inducing fear as a reminder of Dougier's authority. More severe, unmentioned punishments existed for greater infractions. He had also amassed an \"army\" of Gardemeks which he planned to use to overthrow Wriothesley. Dougier's plans were eventually thwarted, leading to his apprehension and the disbandment of the society."

Most of the merchandise was bought as a treat for the Traveler and Paimon by a small girl Lanoire, who was born in the Fortress. Vidoc, an inmate at the Fortress, told the Traveler and Paimon to find him around the Rag and Bone Shop after they had enough Credit Coupons to exchange for information about the \"hidden rules.\" A book named \"The Art of Negotiation\" can be bought from Alvard.

        "text": "Next to the elevator to the upper level, there's a notice board that was used for the Coupon Millionaire game organized by the guard, Estienne. The winning team had to get more Credit Coupons than other teams to join Estienne on one of his checks outside of the Fortress of Meropide. The Traveler and Paimon formed an alliance with a girl named Lanoire and her mysterious friend, Caterpillar, while the opposing team included Genevieve, Poiret, Rave, and Darcy. The second team had almost won, when it turned out that Caterpillar had gathered a million Credit Coupons through all the years he spent in the Fortress.\nThe Administrative Area is a gathering place of the Tri-Coupon Troupe, whose regular cast consists of Meilhat and Fourmon. They are rehearsing a play called \"The Countess of Monte-Mer,\" but are unsure regarding its ending. The story opens in a land of exiles called Monte-Mer. A woman named Juliette has lost her fiance to a brutal murder, and has been framed and banished for it. The fire of vengeance burns intensely in her bosom, refusing to surrender to either time or silence. There will come a day when she finally escapes and exacts payback on all who were responsible. As chance would have it, not only does she escape Monte-Mer, but she unearths its hidden treasure. One after another, she takes her vengeance on those who wronged her. But what she lost in the euphoria of revenge was her own compassion. When she faces her nemesis of days past, Jerome, who killed her fiance, he tells her to plunge the knife into his chest if vengeance will free her. There are two directions where the plot can go after this scene. One is for Juliette to abort her revenge, and spend the rest of her treasure traveling the world and enjoying life. The other is for her to complete her vengeance, only to realize she still feels empty inside, so she donates all of her wealth to charities, then grows old and dies alone in the place where she first met her fiance. Fourmon thinks that giving up on revenge can count as a kind of freedom. \"Kill your nemesis and you'll be happy\" may sound pleasing, but happiness is created and built, not obtained through destructive means like revenge. People don't gain happiness through retribution, only a sinful pleasure. But when that euphoria fades and they can't find another direction in life, it leaves naught but a huge void inside. In the process of getting revenge, it's vital that they find another means of redemption beyond vengeance itself. On the contrary, Meilhat believes that revenge will be a better ending as Jerome is the linchpin of the whole revenge story. If he doesn't feel the sting of vengeance, it will feel like a complete letdown. Making the character just imagine the pain and emptiness is also different from the character actually experiencing the same after doing the deed."

A bodyguard, Nizami, can be fought with on the Pankration Ring. Though the rules state that it is \"Pankration,\" and thus is hand-to-hand combat, \"using other handheld weapons to fight others\" would not be considered a rule violation. As long as special conditions are met, whether Sternshield Crab or a clockwork meka, all can stand on the stage of the Pankration Ring. The winning team will receive Credit Coupons as well as a fantastic Fonta Trophy. When shown at the Fontaine Research Institute, the winner is able to drink all the Fonta they would like, for free. Once, the institute wanted to test their new red Fonta taste, and even offered to sponsor the Pankration tournament so they could push their new product, but the Duke refused to even entertain the idea. The institute representatives are still trying to promote their drink, thus the \"hidden rule\" of the Pankration Ring appeared: If someone tries to support both boxers at the same time, they'll receive a package the next morning, which contains a strange blood-colored liquid."

They first met during the Coupon Millionaire game, where they were on the opposing teams. Genevieve was once a researcher from the institute but due to her anger issues and threatening colleagues with her axe, she was sent to the Fortress. She used to chop firewood for stress-relief when her research hit a wall, so she chose the axe as her main weapon for the tournament. A detective Poiret wasn't familiar with any weapons and chose bottles of Cryo and pneumousia energy stored in a container. After multiple training sessions, Genevieve and Poiret won the Pankration Tournament under the Traveler's guidance. Winning a lot of Coupons, Genevieve plans to continue her research, and Poiret is hoping to expand outside of Fontaine with his detective work."

This graffiti used a special mark from the Fontaine Research Institute that requires a special method to decipher. The Cipher Letter is a technology developed by Mr. Butor, Clynes's benefactor, and few know how to decode it, even at the Fontaine Research Institute. The Fortress guards, Galvaryet and Maupoil, tried all kinds of cleaners to wipe graffiti off the walls with no result, so they asked the Traveler for help. It turned out that Clynes hoped to catch up with some acquaintances who would be able to decipher the mark because they would have something in common to talk about. Although Clynes is free to leave the Fortress, he chooses to stay there only worrying about not seeing his friends.\nOn this level, the former researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute, Nacker, and \"Tricky Bulle Fruit\" can be found. Nacker was sent to the Fortress of Meropide due to stealing the Arkhium Core from the institute and initiating the second explosion of the Central Laboratory. \"Tricky Bulle Fruit\" used to be a member of the Fruity Order, a group of Treasure Hoarders named after fruit. He found the unfinished formula of \"Pure Water\" in the institute ruins and managed to make a potion, hoping that his adopted sister Blanche could have a better future than he did. He sent the complete formula to the institute and went to the Fortress. Currently, he is planning to open a shop but doesn't want to attract Alvard's attention.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Sigewinne turned to her teacher, and the doctor gave her a potion that could change her appearance. The Melusine became human-like and was able to save her friend, but was accused of a crime.

Now Sigewinne is the head nurse of the Fortress, and for patients, she seems like an angel descended from heaven, and the \"sun\" of the Fortress, which brings a radiant warmth to their dark, damp prison. To thank the \"angel\" for her kindness and care, the guards added another \"unwritten rule\" to the set of numerous rules of the Meropide fortress: any who are rude to Sigewinne are punished extra harshly. The inmates, for their part, also have an unspoken agreement that any particularly wild and violent newcomers must receive a \"warning\" upon being admitted. Sigewinne herself is blissfully unaware of all these customs that have cropped up around her, and simply serves her patients as she always has.\nWhen the Fatui Harbinger Arlecchino, sent Lyney, Lynette and Freminet from the House of the Hearth to investigate the disappearance of another Harbinger, Lynette was supposed to investigate the infirmary, but Sigewinne figured out her plan. Behind the crates, there was a secret passage leading to the Wingalet factory, which the researchers Lourvine and Jurieu used.\nOn the upper level of the Administrative Area, a former Senior Researcher, Edwin Eastinghouse, and \"Intrepid Valberry\" can be found. Edwin first was accused of the destruction of the Central Laboratory in the Fontaine Research Institute and was presumed dead, but later found hiding in the Erinnyes Forest. Although he claimed to be innocent, he was sent to the Fortress for harming the institute. \"Intrepid Valberry\" is \"Tricky Bulle Fruit's\" friend who left the Fruity Order. Although he and \"Tricky Bulle Fruit\" live nearby, \"Intrepid Valberry\" still thinks that his friend is dead while \"Tricky Bulle Fruit\" believes his eyes deceive him."

Her mother Agness gave birth to her in the Fortress and didn't have a chance to prepare documents for her daughter. Agness died because of the illness, and Lanoire was left in prison because she didn't exist by documents. She became friends with Caterpillar, who lived in the Fortress of Meropide for 400 years. In this room, Lanoire, Caterpillar, the Traveler, and Paimon gathered to discuss their plans. The Traveler and Paimon also slept there during their time in prison.\nIn the Dormitory Block, certified TCG players, Rosolino and Carranza, can be found. Rosolino is a staff member of the Fortress who seems to have quite the reputation amongst younger folks, and Carranza is an inmate who loves to engage in theorycrafting, which he has put to good use in analyzing his deck.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Sigewinne has only the best intentions with her \"surprise gift,\" and doesn't want anyone to find out about what she does, but as she perceives the world differently from humans, her sense of aesthetics can be very alien to the inmates.\nDue to his work in the Production Zone, an inmate Lechlade began to feel dizzy. He thought that the yellow-green stones nearby were affecting his health and that he was going to die there. His symptoms were headaches, heart palpitations, hands and feet growing cold, and a feeling that his head was going to burst. When the Traveler asked the Fortress doctor, Arderne, for help, it turned out that Lechlade misdiagnosed a patient when he was still on the outside, ignoring some early warning results, and healthcare outcomes, and had been paranoid ever since. Receiving the \"Pure Water,\" a mysterious potion said to be the legacy of a certain genius Potioneer, the man immediately started feeling better.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

If someone requires one of the connecting paths to be opened for official Fortress business, they must operate the drive valve only under the supervision of a technical expert to prevent accidents. This route has been used by the Traveler, Paimon, and their friends, Caterpillar and Lanoire, to escape the Fortress of Meropide and return to the surface. The guard Noailles tried to stop them but with the help of other guards, Estienne and Maupoil, they escaped the Fortress.\nIn the Abandoned Production Zone, certified TCG player, Camden, can be found.
