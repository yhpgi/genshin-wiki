Their most distinctive feature was the ability to choose what traits it wished to pass on to its offspring. Because of their great hatred for humanity, these vishaps will lose any visual acuity by the time they reach maturity. At the same time, they have also evolved a certain degree of elemental polymorphism for combat purposes.",
