Some had the idea of taking back the ruins lost to the waves and building an underwater city, whereas others looked up to the untouchable sky islands overhead with the intention of building a metropolis in the clouds.</p><p>Underwater Patrol Meks were conceived by the former, but judging from the results, it is the latter that have gained the upper hand in recent years.</p>",
