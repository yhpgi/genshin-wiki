        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Story 1</color>\n\"Let's go. She's not going to make it.\"\n\"But, our orders were to...\"\nThe young child held on to her broken, bloody arm, and watched the two figures before her through blurry eyes.\nIn the end, the one who seemed to be in charge bade the other to stop talking. They turned around, then vanished into the distance.\nNot long ago, her people had learned that the universe held more civilizations than they ever imagined. In the past, the chance to interact with those beyond their world had been limited to a wizened, scholarly few.\nJust a few months ago, the leaders had announced that trade relations were amicable. So why...?\nBeams cracked and splintered under tongues of flame. In the infernal maw the little girl lay, suffocated by smoke, heat, and blood loss.\nAs the debris and charred wood that buried her were dug away, she heard a sound... Something squeaking.\nHer eyelids had been crusted shut with dried blood. But even so blinded, she could sense the light's intrusion.\nAnd she could hear footsteps crunching on scorched terrain, each footfall shattering the broken bricks beneath it.\nThe newcomer easily freed the little girl from the wreckage restraining her. Then, placing one massive hand on her shoulder, they yanked her out.\nThe pain of being pulled so suddenly made her think that all her limbs had been torn off at once. She cried — and as tears forced their way through her eyelids, they washed away the coagulated blood.\nShe was surprised to find that she was still hydrated enough to cry.\nBut the feeling lasted barely a moment. The next thing she knew, the agony sent her spiraling into unconsciousness.\nShe was surprised to wake up again. She had not thought she would be granted the mercy of opening her eyes a second time. Though her vision still swam, she could make out a bonfire, and the tall man who sat before it cross-legged. Off to the side, a hulking rat-like beast cowered in the shadows, inky eyes mirroring the fire's wild flicker.\n\"Awake, then? Don't waste your breath on asking questions unrelated to your survival.\"\nThe man did not so much as glance her way. He continued to tend the bonfire with his blade.\n\"So. Do you want to die, or do you want to live?\"\nShe wanted to ask him why she was still alive at all. She wanted to ask who he was. But he had warned her not to waste her breath.\nSo the girl simply turned her gaze to the starry sky and nodded.\nHaving received her answer, the man plucked his sword from the embers, and slew the rat-like beast in one swing. He cut the meat from its legs, skewered the chunks using his weapon, and cooked them over the open fire. At last, he stood up — something he seldom did — and shoved the meat between her teeth. Bland as it was, the oiliness of the fat was more than a feast for the starving girl.\nAt the very least, he didn't ask her to feed herself. It seemed he understood that her limbs were ruined beyond repair.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 2</color>\nOnce the girl's wounds had stabilized, the man allowed her to ask some trivial questions.\n\"Are you also one of the survivors?\"\n\"I am not.\"\n\"Then why can I understand you?\"\n\"There is only one state of chaos, and only one definition of the void. Order, by contrast, can be assembled a thousand different ways.\"\n\"The people of your planet once relied on their great adaptability to make contact with the Abyss, and even after death, the lingering power they carried retains some... trace records of this. That power is similar in essence to my own.\"\n\"So I wove together the dying echoes of countless souls, and spent quite some time learning from them — half a day or so, I believe.\"\n\"Just to learn our language? Then, my father and mother...\"\n\"Are dead. Devoured as meager meat for strength — gulped down like scraps.\"\nThe man answered the second question, then continued:\n\"At first, I believed those people went through the trouble of eradicating all life on this planet because there was something worth destroying. Some incredible technology with which the Abyss might be wielded, perhaps.\"\n\"But I was mistaken. Your methods are crude, your technologies primitive. One might think your civilization lacked even one individual who possessed any ambition — or strength — in all its history.\"\n\"You...!\"\n\"Are you not the same? Did you not eat the flesh of the creature that dug you out of the ruins?\"\n\"Though, I should mention I brought it here from another planet, since all life on yours is extinct.\"\n\"I doubt I will even find a single species adept at looking for things here.\"\nThe girl wanted to say something, but no words rose to her lips. Instead, she decided to ask something else.\n\"Why am I still alive?\"\n\"Your civilization coexisted with the Abyss. Though none ever used it directly, each and every one of you was tainted in some way.\"\n\"This strengthened your constitutions slightly. Had an ordinary human been in your place, they would have been suffocated, roasted, then crushed by the collapsing ceiling.\"\n\"So you can use this power to get stronger?\"\nThe man's eyes glinted in the firelight, a perceptible change within them. \"Do you wish to become stronger?\"\nThe girl nodded.\n\"Even if it costs you everything? Even if you are judged and damned for using foul means to emerge victorious... Do you still wish to become stronger?\"\nThe girl answered, her words blown away by the winds sweeping that desolate planet.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 3</color>\nShe was now called Skirk.\nHer severed tendons and shattered bones were restored by the man known as \"The Foul.\" But this was no cause for celebration.\nFor the man made her wield a blade every day and train until her limbs were ruined anew. It was as though he simply wanted her to feel pain.\nEvery day, after training, her broken body would be restored yet again.\nShe traveled across the universe with \"The Foul,\" bearing witness to the trail of enemy graves he left in his wake.\nA weapon forged using the pooled resources of an entire star system. A god manifested by the unity of a whole civilization's beliefs. The mightiest warrior among billions...\nHe buried them all. And as Skirk grew from the strength to strength, a revelation came upon her: Nobody had ever forced her master to use the true extent of his power.\nIf it was a wicked beast, he ate its flesh. If it was a god or a machine, he absorbed its energy.\nIf it was a warrior or mage, he played with his food — forcing them to use every trick in their book, then cutting them down once he tired of the charade.\nTo her master, this was what it meant to \"devour.\"\nSkirk's limbs were replaced with Abyssal phantasms. Never again would they hurt.\nHer pain receptors, having been overloaded and utterly numbed over the long years, would never again fire a signal.\nPain was simply a biological avoidance mechanism. So, Skirk knew what her body was telling her:\nShe was very strong. Few things could now pose a threat to her.\nThis gave her some confidence. One day, she decided to dredge up the question she'd been waiting to ask all this time:\n\"Why did you save me back then?\"\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 4</color>\n\"It was a spontaneous impulse, nothing more.\"\nHer master, whose true name was Surtalogi, replied thusly.\n\"I may be the greatest calamity in the whole universe at this moment. Do you believe that?\"\n\"There is no need to discuss my belief in the matter, Master. Those that once doubted are now but dust in the void.\"\n\"Hmph. Strength is what I have always pursued — the kind that lets one tear through every lie and manipulation.\"\n\"But... having come this far, I find myself struck by one worry...\"\n\"...That I might someday get bored.\"\nSkirk listened quietly. She couldn't fathom that the life of such a universe-shaking villain could be \"boring.\"\n\"After seeking the strongest warriors the universe has to offer, there may no longer be any further strength for me to seek.\"\n\"How did that story go again? 'Distance is measured by the heart, and my heart is slightly larger than the universe.'\"\n\"Once the whole universe becomes my front lawn, all I shall see from then on will be two anthills waging pint-sized war... I shall be in my prime then — and at my most weary.\"\nOf course, Surtalogi was not one for reading stories. This quote only came to mind because, some time ago, he had come across a scrap drifting through the universe, one carrying the scent of his homeland.\nHe took one look at the title and preface before throwing it away. It just so happened that those introductory words contained the aforementioned passage.\n\"So, the thought came to me of taking disciples, then waiting for them to mature before seeking them out for my amusement. You are the first of them.\"\n\"And once you leave, I will see you as my student no longer.\"\n\"I will strip you of everything: That which I gave you, that which you have claimed for yourself, even the unrelated miscellany around you... all will be reduced to ruin.\"\nSkirk knew none of this was some untruth meant to spur her on. Between her and Surtalogi, there was no deep master-student bond, no great care or far-reaching intent.\nEverything Surtalogi said, he meant at face value. One day, they would surely fight to the death.\nThere are many paths one can take in the world, but once you step on one, the alternatives wither away.\nFrom that day onward, it was like a blade had descended from nowhere and now hung above Skirk's head. Her destiny, her life... All of it now melded together and crystallized into a singular goal: \"Getting stronger.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 5</color>\n\"Master, since you mentioned that your group once divided enough Abyssal power amongst yourselves to overturn an entire world — or at least a sixth of it...\"\n\"How is it that you are now many times stronger than an entire world, even when alone?\"\n\"Did I save an idiot back then?\"\n\"Listen well. When the fruit of a tree dies, its seeds are sown in the rotten soil. Naturally, these seeds may grow into stronger trees that bear harvests a hundred, or even a thousand times richer.\"\n\"Even if only one or two survivors escape a doomed world, their will alone can become strong enough to reforge the very world they lost.\"\nWith their parting imminent, Skirk no longer bothered to feign reverence or obedience.\nFear only serves as a spur for the weak. But when you grow stronger, unconquered fear will become naught but a shackle.\nIn the end, she resolved to bid her master farewell. She headed back to Surtalogi's homeland, to the world known as \"Teyvat.\"\nShe wanted to find that mother-tree. The tree that had borne corrupt fruit, whose tainted seed had grown into a truly formidable arbor.\nFrom that moment on, a great darkness had loomed over the whole forest — the shadow her master cast over the universe at large.\nAll across the sea of stars, other civilizations that saw her naturally regarded her as an ally of \"The Foul.\"\nEvery community she encountered during her travels took her for a member of the \"Cosmic Calamity,\" and kept their distance in wary defense.\n...Except for Teyvat, where the one who supervised its borders lowered her guard after talking to Skirk. Upon the establishment of an agreement, she granted the latter limited passage within the world.\n\"You do not belong there. It is not your home.\"\nThe words of The Foul remained etched in her heart, never to fade away.\nBut what if a wish, flung at a shooting star as it passed in fire-fraught trails, could stitch even the faintest thread between it and the world?\n<color=#ffd780>Her Answer</color>\n\"Even if it costs you everything? Even if you are judged and damned for using foul means to emerge victorious... Do you still wish to become stronger?\"\nWhat was Skirk's answer, back then? The one that had been blown away by the wind?\nPerhaps, even if the answer were a fleeting \"Yes,\" it would have changed nothing of what came after.\nBut that had not been her reply.\nShe was just a little girl, her mind yet unburdened by craft or cunning. She longed only to thank — and to beg forgiveness from — the first life given to nourish her growth.\n\"Maybe the big rat and I could have been best friends.\"\n...But I ate it.\nTo The Foul, this utterance gained a second meaning: \"I have turned my back even on the one who saved me from the ruins. What remains, then, that I cannot discard?\"\nNone can say how much of the exchange was colored by self-indulgence or misunderstanding, and how much of it was intentional.\nBut beyond this, there may have been some misunderstandings between the two that neither had expected.\n\"Well then. Since I was the one who saved you that day, will you also kill me one day in pursuit of strength?\"\nThe Foul was stirred to expectation by his own words, but in her despair, the little girl did not notice.\n<color=#ffd780>The Seven-Shifting Serpent</color>\nThe \"Seven-Shifting Serpent\" is a little trick that The Foul passed down to Skirk.\nIt was originally known as \"Chaos Permeation,\" a minor spell developed by Khaenri'ah's Universitas Magistrorum, and it was made to mock Teyvat's wielders of elemental power. Users of this spell could use Abyssal energy to evoke effects similar to the Elements. The underlying principle was analogous to using the Abyss to permeate reality, creating specific forms of negative pressure to thereby call upon the flow of a corresponding Element's energy.\nTo Khaenri'ah, \"Chaos Permeation\" was a mere party trick employed in performances and parades.\nAs a warrior, The Foul knew nothing of this technique at first. But as his understanding of Abyssal power deepened, he came to master it almost instantly. While ordinary performers could spend months practicing the shifting of a single Element just to scrape by as street entertainers, The Foul was able to effortlessly cycle through all seven on his first attempt.\nHe passed this technique down to Skirk, but not so she could fall back on performances if she was strapped for Mora. After all, demonstrating mastery of Abyssal techniques across the seven surface nations was something only a glutton for punishment would do.\n\"In my homeland, the Seven Elements represent the natural order of things. So if you wish to conceal your power for longer, disguise it using this trick.\""

Otherwise, you will stagnate.\n<color=#ffd780>About Surtalogi</color>\nVery few people manage to earn themselves a name like \"The Foul\" and live up to it. I'm sure whoever gave him that name must have truly despised him. Master's certainly done his fair share of disgraceful things, and the fact that he is a former knight who turned his back on the chivalric code doesn't exactly make things any better. And yet, plenty of people still choose to follow him. They're drawn to his strength, composure, and confidence, and the fact that he's candid with everyone regardless of their background. He's not driven by emotion — he's on a mission to become a version of himself that is complete and perfected... That's why he's as powerful as he is. It's also why he's so dangerous."

As the eldest son, I was set to inherit our title. But, I contracted an incurable illness as a child, and everyone gave up on me.\nI trained the sword harder than anyone else, defeated all of my peers, but it was all in vain. When other people looked at me, all I saw in their eyes was pity or a strange glee in my misfortune. Even my parents were just waiting for me to die.\nOver time, my heart hardened, and I became aimless. That was the point where I met your master, Surtalogi.\nWe were similar in age, but different in background. He was born in prison, the son of criminals who had been sentenced to death. He spent his childhood wandering the streets facing more criticism than the literary works in the Universitas Magistrorum.\nYet, he always wore a smile on his face, as if kindness and malice were one and the same, and he could not see the difference.\nI still remember what he said to me when we first met: \"You need to fight to survive. Even if it's a losing battle, it should light a fire under you. How can you sit back like this and go down without a fight?\"\nHe was the first to acknowledge that I was worth something, and he inspired me to keep going. When we sparred together, it was the first time I actually felt the thrill of combat.\nWhen I was ten, he stole forbidden research materials and managed to cure my illness. It was like there was nothing in this world he couldn't accomplish... When it came to the human form, he was always intent on pushing the boundaries of possibility.\nBut, somewhere along the way, I fell behind. My talents were nothing compared to his, and at some point, I realized he had pulled so far ahead, I was too embarrassed to even ask him to spar.\nAfter his \"grand endeavor\" was successful, he sought me out and said to me...\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : This planet no longer holds anything of interest to me, so I'm leaving. But first, I have an offer. I can use a power I have just refined to break the curse of immortality for you.\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : Your death was once what we worked so hard to prevent. But the \"immortality\" you now face is a different kind of pain altogether.\n<color=#37ffff>Skofnungr</color> : Hahaha... I'll pass. Immortality doesn't sound so bad to me. Since I can't die, it means I have an infinite amount of time to get stronger. Maybe I'll finally catch up to you one day, and we can spar like we used to.\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : Are you sure? I cannot say when I will return. Your body... Or rather, your soul might not be able to withstand this curse.\n<color=#37ffff>Skofnungr</color> : Haha... All I can do is try. After all, a wise man once told me, people need to fight for their own survival.\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : Wise indeed. Nevertheless, if you grow weary of the pain of immortality, and wish to experience a good sparring match before you wither away, seek out my disciple.\n<color=#37ffff>Skofnungr</color> : Disciple? Never thought I'd hear that word coming from you...\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : Nor I. But, Vedrfolnir said I was destined to find a disciple out there in the universe and bring her to Teyvat.\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : You know as well as I, Vedrfolnir's prophecies are never wrong.\n<color=#37ffff>Skofnungr</color> : Huh. Well, now I'm curious about who this disciple of yours will be...\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : All Vedrfolnir said was that, one day, \"the stars shall bow in her honor.\"\n<color=#37ffff>Skofnungr</color> : Sounds pretty impressive.\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : Of course. Only the most outstanding people would have the right to become my disciple.\n<color=#37ffff>Skofnungr</color> : Hahaha... Still as self-assured as ever, I see. But, you're not wrong.\n<color=#37ffff>Surtalogi</color> : I'll be leaving, then. Oh, and if you're serious about getting stronger, I left you a little gift in the Primordial Sea. As I've said before — walk whatever path you want. Freedom means even the wicked get to make their own choices.\nWaiting for me in the Primordial Sea was the All-Devouring Narwhal, already beaten into submission by Surtalogi. In its weakened state, I was able to cut off part of its flesh and sew it into my own heart."
