You can access the Transfer Terminal's viewfinder to collect and transfer energy from different storage devices.\nIf there is another Transfer Terminal within your viewfinder, you can switch to that other Transfer Terminal's view by <color=#ffe14b>aiming your crosshairs at said terminal and pressing it</color> . All collected energy will be transferred to said new terminal.\nOther than transferring energy, a Transfer Terminal can also convert cipher letters within its view into text."
