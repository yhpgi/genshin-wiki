Our mouths are structured differently from yours, so I must thank you for your effort.\"\nWe had not noticed the mother fox approaching. Her eyes were like bottomless lakes, and the little fox quietly hid himself among the dandelions to escape her gaze.\n\"When he has mastered human language,\"\nI thought to myself.\n\"When he has mastered human language,\"\nShe spoke softly."
