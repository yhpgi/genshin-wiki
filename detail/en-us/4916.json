The Melusines lived in the Merusea Village, which they built inside the Elynas's body. They learned how to build houses from their \"Father.\" Twenty years later, some Melusines wanted to go to the Court of Fontaine to see how people lived and find the meaning of their existence. Carole became one of the first Melusines who, with the help of the young Iudex of Fontaine, Neuvillette, a Hydro Dragon, entered the Court of Fontaine."

Carole became the first Melusine in the Marechaussee Phantom, and the leader of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Vautrin, was assigned as her partner. The people of the Court of Fontaine had never seen Melusines before, so they treated them with caution and dissatisfaction, as there were rumors that Melusines were creatures of disaster that posed a danger to others. They threw stones at the Melusines and told them to return to their village. Neuvillette and Carole knew that it would take a lot of time and effort for people and Melusines to live in harmony and understanding, but Carole was ready for this long and difficult path, as her life became more meaningful."

Carole hoped that the Melusines would soon begin to live peacefully with people, but this medal only further angered the supporters of the old regime, whose interests were infringed upon as a result of Neuvillette's reform. They decided to commit a murder and blame it on the Melusines in order to drive them out of the city and teach Neuvillette a lesson.\nSupporters of the old regime tricked Carole to come to the crime scene and brought charges against her. After this, they sowed panic among the people in order to force Neuvillette to admit his mistakes and give up power. Carole decided to sacrifice herself to soften the situation, and the Gardes were unable to intervene in time due to the angry crowd.\nVautrin, having learned about what had happened, decided to avenge Carole and personally killed all the conspirators. He knew that Neuvillette would be forced to declare him guilty and exile him to the Fortress of Meropide, but he could not help but intervene. Carole reminded Vautrin of his younger sister, Illaria, who died when he was little. Carole and Illaria were both kind and innocent, and they always believed in the best. Vautrin understood that kind souls like Carole were more susceptible to deception and betrayal, so he tried to force her to retreat so that people would not harm her.\nCarole's bravery and sacrifice ultimately led to her dream being realized: 400 years later, the Melusines are respected members of society in the Court of Fontaine, coexisting peacefully with humans. Because of Carole's heroic deed, the emblem of the Maison Gardiennage featured Melusines as a sign of respect and gratitude to these creatures.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
