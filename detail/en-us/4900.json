Once upon a time, the Temple of the Wolf was built for him, where people worshiped the Wolf of the North, but over time, the Four Winds were forgotten.\nMany years ago, a mechanism called the \"Field Tiller\" accidentally ended up in Andrius's arena, and he mistook the mechanism for a brave man who challenged him. The machine could not think, but every part of it was designed for killing and fighting. It could spin, fly high into the air, and shoot fireballs. In the end, Andrius was able to defeat the machine, but it managed to leave the arena before falling. For the people of ancient Mondstadt, the \"Field Tiller\" became the \"Tyrant's Final Fury,\" as they could not understand the true nature of the mechanism. This machine was the prototype for all the Ruin Guards made in Khaenri'ah and possessed the Eye of the first Field Tiller, with the help of which the Abyss Order, opposed to the Seven Kingdoms, tried to create a mechanical deity to overthrow the gods of Celestia from their thrones.\nNowadays, the wolves of Wolvendom have almost no contact with people, but one day they accepted a child into their pack, later named Razor, whom they consider their \"Lupical,\" that is, family. One day, the Abyss Order wanted Andrius to serve them, and in return, they promised the spirit to return his divine powers. The Abyss Herald attempted to perform a ritual to possess the mind of the King of the North, just as the Abyss mage once poisoned the mind of the Dragon of the East, Dvalin. The Herald lured Andrius under the pretense of challenging him to battle but was stopped by Razor and the Traveler.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
