Therefore, one who marshals a legion must be like a conductor, whose shield and sword are like the strings and bow of a violin, performing a blazing melody like the raging flames upon the merciless battlefield.</p><p>\"War is a necessary evil on the path to all-encompassing peace.\" Thus spake a Harmost, one who once led the golem legions to conquest over the entire high sea.</p>",
