It was powered by a mechanical art and could be used to great effect as an accompanying instrument. In Guizhong's opinion, while mechanisms were no substitute for human composers, they were yet capable of producing simple but fine melodies. Streetward Rambler believed music to be an expression of the soul, an emotional enterprise that could never hope to be replicated by machinery. They argued endlessly until Cloud Retainer asked Rex Lapis to intercede. He confiscated the bell and designated it for ceremonial use. Thereafter, Guizhong and Streetward Rambler were often seen convening in the mountains, discussing music, mechanics, and all the affairs of the mortal world."

Many Adepti wanted to destroy Liyue Harbor for allowing the death of the Geo Archon and did not want to leave power to the people. Madame Ping, on the contrary, wanted to entrust Liyue to the Qixing, who also fought Osial. She knew that Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, treasured the Jade Chamber with which Osial was defeated. And if she was willing to sacrifice her life's work to protect Liyue, then she was worthy of ruling it.\nWhen the Rite of Parting was finally performed, Madame Ping, as a sign of gratitude for the help, gifted the abode enclosed in a teapot to the Traveler and Paimon so that they would always have a roof over their head. The Sub-Space called the Serenitea Pot was created using rare Smaragdus Jadeite and Shimmersoil from the banks of Dihua Marsh. Madame Ping asked her friend Teapot Spirit Rain Calmer, also known as Tubby, to be in charge of this Sub-Space.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Amongst the Adepti, Streetward Rambler is among those who interact more with mortals. She has a great many disciples, the youngest of whom is named Yaoyao. Yaoyao's treasuring of birds, flowers, fish, and even rocks reminded Streetward Rambler of the Adepti and their care for all things, which drew her interest. Yaoyao was born in a quiet place near Qingce Village. When Yaoyao first became the Adeptus's disciple, she was still too young to have learned to read and write, and so her master began teaching her the etiquette of poetry tomes. As she grew, Streetward Rambler would gradually add the rites of the Adepti, their methods of self-cultivation, and her own spear arts into Yaoyao's curriculum. The voluminous nature of such teachings makes committing them to memory challenging for Yaoyao. Still, her master does not overly fret about such things, for it is apparent to her that Yaoyao has indeed listened to those lessons. Having initially resolved to be a sterner taskmistress, Streetward Rambler was relieved to see Yaoyao's earnest attitude and thus relaxed her requirements a little. That Yaoyao genuinely treated her as her grandmother warmed the cockles of her heart greatly as well.\nIndeed, despite being half the height of an adult, Yaoyao tended to Streetward Rambler's meals and fussed over her health when the hotter parts of the year gave way to the cold as if forgetting that headaches and fevers were not common problems for the Adepti. Indeed, Streetward Rambler came to feel as if she had been blessed with a granddaughter, and from then on, she never said a strict word to the child ever again. While she had not begun this relationship with any intention apart from taking a disciple, she now finds herself and Yaoyao inseparable. Which is alright, she supposes. Let the little one stay by her side for some time yet — she still has much to teach, after all."

They say it was the most beautiful, moving melody he had ever heard. Even in that life-and-death moment, the ethereal music seized his full attention and almost made him forget the fact that he was drowning. When he finally came to, he found that he had already been brought ashore. Not too far from him stood an unfamiliar woman with an almost divine aura. Once she saw that he was no longer in danger, she left without a word. The traveler tried to run after her to show his gratitude. Although a mere dozen paces separated them, no matter how quickly he gave chase, he drew no closer and remained a dozen paces behind. In the end, all he could do was bow in thanks to the woman as he watched her walk away towards the rivers and mountains in the distance before he turned around and made his way home. Once he returned to Fontaine, he began to learn an instrument to spread his story far and wide, just like the bards. After generations of retelling, embellishing, and dramatizing, people have come to think of that lady as something like a fairy. The story's become something of a local legend in Fontaine. It's called \"The Lady Overlooking the Lake.\" People now say that if you go down to the lakeside and play an instrument, so long as you play a pleasing melody, you will hear a fairy lady, who is hiding out of sight, playing along with you.\nAs the years passed, the traveler's descendant, Dvorak, embarked on a journey to discover the truth of this tale. He decided to retrace his ancestor's steps and search for that lady's modern-day descendants. He spent many years on the road, and the wish that he had spent half his life chasing after had become something of an obsession. Once, Dvorak prayed for the Anemo Archon's guidance in the Mondstadt Cathedral, and as soon as he set foot back outside the front gate, he noticed a cluster of leaves being blown in the wind, further and further west, towards Stone Gate. A friendly local told him that this meant the wind was guiding him toward Liyue, so Dvorak followed their advice and made his way there."

Indeed, the love she receives from the adepti at her young age is quite an enviable matter.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 1</color>\nAs the people of Liyue Harbor see it, Madame Ping is often found with Yaoyao by her side, the two seeming the very image of a loving grandmother and granddaughter.\nIn truth, however, there is no blood relation between them, and Yaoyao is Madame Ping's — or should we say Streetward Rambler's — disciple.\nWhen Yaoyao first became the adeptus' disciple, she was still too young to have learned to read and write, and so her master began by teaching her the etiquette of tomes of poetry on a daily basis.\nAs she grew, Streetward Rambler would gradually add the rites of the adepti, their methods of self-cultivation, and her own spear arts into Yaoyao's curriculum.\nThe voluminous nature of such teachings makes committing them to memory a challenge for Yaoyao, but her master does not overly fret about such things, for it is apparent to her that Yaoyao has indeed listened to those lessons.\nWhile her spear's shaft is heavy and ill-aligned to a child's easy wielding, Yaoyao practices every day nonetheless.\nAnd while books of poetry might be hard to memorize, she reads them daily nonetheless, to the point where she can expound on the relationship between full stomachs and righteousness in her sleep.\nHaving initially resolved to be a sterner taskmistress, Streetward Rambler was relieved to see Yaoyao's earnest attitude, and thus relaxed her requirements a little.\nThat Yaoyao genuinely treated her as her grandmother warmed the cockles of her heart greatly as well.\nIndeed, despite being half the height of an adult, Yaoyao tended to Streetward Rambler's meals and fretted over her health when the hotter parts of the year give way to the cold, as if forgetting that headaches and fevers were not common problems for the adepti.\nIndeed, Streetward Rambler came to feel as if she really had been blessed with a granddaughter, and from then on, she never said a strict word to the child ever again.\nWhile she had not begun this relationship with any intention apart from taking a disciple, she now finds herself and Yaoyao inseparable. Which is alright, she supposes. Let the little one stay by her side for some time yet — she still has much to teach, after all.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 2</color>\nThis story begins well before Yaoyao was even born. Her parents, preferring life out in the mountain wilds, chose to move away from Liyue Harbor and search for a quiet place near Qingce Village to live, building their own abode and living life in relative seclusion.\nThere they lived in solitude by the mountains and waters, and their backyard had a small field in which they grew melons, fruits, and vegetables.\nThe closest settlement to them was Qingce Village, and when they lacked for any daily necessities, they would bring the fruits of their field to the village and trade for what they required.\nThis was the home to which Yaoyao was born.\nThus did she gain the birds, beasts, and fish for companions while she was still a babbling babe, and thus did she take her first tottering steps in the radish field behind her house.\nHer gentle, pure soul was first cultivated in this quiet and cozy garden.\nLater, she would catch the eye of an adeptus and be taken in as her disciple.\nAt first, her parents were not entirely willing to let their daughter live long-term in Liyue Harbor with said adeptus, for they feared that their innocent daughter, having long been used to life in the mountains, would find herself led astray by the bright lights of the big city.\nBut Streetward Rambler's counsel ultimately brought them round:\n\"Perhaps solitude in the mountains shall indeed keep one from mortal stain, but such lonesomeness may not be what Yaoyao desires for her future. Let her have the chance to see the myriad faces of the world for herself.\"\nOnly then did her parents give her into the care of the adeptus, and time has only demonstrated the wisdom of that choice.\nIn Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao would become a much more outgoing person with the help of her master and a host of good friends. But when the festive season comes along, she does take leave of her master to see her parents at home.\nIndeed, if one desired a good teacher for one's child, could there be a more ideal pick than an adeptus?\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 3</color>\nMadame Ping's old acquaintances will sometimes drop by to visit her, and during such times, Yaoyao will accompany her master and her master's guests in roaming the city.\nHaving come from afar, these guests will often not only visit the stores and food stands, but also attend storytelling sessions or Liyue opera performances at Heyu Tea House.\nOf course, being the large city that it is, Liyue Harbor has no lack of people who enjoy spending some downtime at the teahouse, including many outlanders who appreciate the cultures of other nations.\nOnce, three outlanders, first-time visitors to Liyue Harbor, sat at the table beside that of Yaoyao and company. Having heard an opera about the adepti of Liyue, they began to discuss that very topic over tea and snacks.\nUnable to get a word in lengthwise in the conversation between her master and her guest, Yaoyao succumbed to boredom, listening in on the nearby chat while eating some treats.\nThe lady from Inazuma seemed to think that Liyue's adepti were not much different from the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, having charge over matters divine and literary alike.\nThe visitor from Fontaine was of an obdurate view that the adepti were in the employ of the state apparatus. Had he met Ganyu, the Qixing's secretary before? Or did that nation simply have a similar arrangement?\nThe adventurer from Mondstadt was for his part very taken with the legends of the adepti, for he had only heard the bards sing songs of the gods, but had never himself met one or any of their familiars.\nUnable to resist, he asked the tea master if they had ever spoken to an adeptus, only to be disappointed by the reply:\n\"It is but a story, for we mortals do not daily dwell in Jueyun Karst, and few are the opportunities to meet the adepti.\"\nYaoyao, finding this statement to be incorrect, could not help but rebut thusly: \"That's not true. The adepti are among us. I mean, Uncle Moon Carver just said that the story was very interesting.\"\nFor some reason she could not fathom, Madame Ping's guest stopped speaking altogether, and Madame Ping laughed, saying a few words to the tea master to change the topic.\nYaoyao, however, did not understand: Why did people find the adepti very distant from their daily lives? The adepti were amongst them — they just didn't readily reveal themselves, that's all.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 4</color>\nNot all people can be accepted and taken as disciples by the adepti — only those whose destinies are entwined with these blessed beings may become privy to their arts and ways.\nYaoyao once asked her master: \"Why do you say that our destinies are entwined? What does that mean?\"\n\"It means that you and I have things in common that led to our meeting.\"\nThis answer, of course, was akin to some overarching axiom in a book, crushing much meaning into very few words, and has by no means been easy for Yaoyao to wrap her head around.\nYaoyao remembers that she had been playing in the mountains as usual when she first met her master.\nAt that time, she was still living with her parents, and when she went out to play, she would speak to the stones and the clouds about her feelings. In her eyes, the flowers, birds, fish, insects, and the mountains, rocks, and rivers were all her precious playmates.\nThat day, however, the stones and the clouds replied when she spoke, and thus overjoyed, she chatted with them throughout the entire day.\nThen the adeptus recalled her mystical arts, and the illusory stones and clouds dissipated, revealing Streetward Rambler to Yaoyao in her true form — and yet, Yaoyao was not startled.\nIt is the adepti way to protect the world and the people who live in it, and the adepti of Liyue do not merely defend humanity, but cherish also the things of nature. All such things are bound within their own natural cycles, and so long as one acts in concert with these cycles, all things will grow in their time and will not encroach upon one another.\nYaoyao's treasuring of her playmates bore similarity indeed to the adepti and their care for all things, and it was this that drew Streetward Rambler's interest.\nShame, then, that Yaoyao could not for the life of her comprehend the complexities of her master's reply, and thus did she lay the question aside for the time being.\n<color=#ffd780>Yuegui</color>\nStreetward Rambler has acquaintances all across Liyue, and even early on, she had paid many of them a visit, saying that her newest disciple's training was not quite complete yet, and asking them to take care of the young girl should they encounter her.\nHer original intention was simply to introduce her student and ask that they help teach Yaoyao further, that her eventual learning might increase.\nYaoyao's clever and caring manner, however, proved more lovable than Streetward Rambler had expected, and Cloud Retainer would take the request to heart.\nBefore either master or pupil had realized it, Cloud Retainer had already completed the creation of a wondrous machine rabbit.\n\"Well then, Yaoyao, one purposes to give this to you. Should you encounter any danger, call upon it, and it shall answer.\"\nYaoyao was very taken with this cute rabbit, naming it Yuegui and taking it everywhere with her.\nHaving given this gift, Cloud Retainer would seek out the little girl's master to say, and not without pride, that:\n\"One should inform you first that this device has another function. Should you ever be unable to find Yaoyao, you need only call out, 'Yuegui!', and her location shall be made known to you.\"\n\"Nonetheless, one counsels you not to overuse this feature, for when the child grows older, she will desire her own privacy, and may yet take umbrage to your constant calling upon her. Now, take one's loose relationship with one's pupil Shenhe for example...\"\n\"Oh, not to worry. I understand, Cloud Retainer.\"\n\"And it is good that you do. In any case, Yuegui shall alert us if anyone should try to do her ill without our knowledge — any such churls shall soon need all the luck they can get.\""

        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Story 1</color>\nJust like many other residents of Liyue Harbor, it seems that Xianyun not only has hobbies of her own, but also travels widely and has many friends.\nSo when people see her chatting with Madame Ping by the fish pond nearby Yujing Terrace, they think nothing of it.\n\"I haven't seen much of Mountain Shaper lately. And Moon Carver still hasn't returned that Multi-Purpose Abode Cleaning Talisman I lent him, to this day...\"\n\"Is that so? What might that be then, some sort of new sigil contraption you've come up with?\"\n\"Yes, let me tell you all about it...\"\nEach day, there comes a time when the lights of thousands of homes finally go out, and Liyue Harbor falls silent for a brief while. With nothing more to see before morning, Xianyun takes this opportunity to take a stroll along the narrow path that winds up Mt. Tianheng.\nJagged outcrops pose little obstacle for Xianyun. With a quick jump up and a gust of wind below, she's already at the top in the blink of an eye.\nGazing down upon the murky streets far below, the human known as Xianyun transforms into a crane, and with a flap of her wings lifts herself up toward the firmament.\nBut of course, there's really nothing strange about any of this. Liyue Harbor is a city that embraces all — so it's only natural that some adepti would end up living here too.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 4</color>\nIn the days before their friendships were torn asunder, the adepti would gather from time to time and fill Jueyun Karst with the merry sound of song and music.\nStreetward Rambler had the best sense of melody and played the zither with great beauty, while Guizhong was a natural composer.\nThe yakshas Bonanus and Indarias would often accompany Cloud Retainer, beating time and singing along to Streetward Rambler's melodies. Sometimes, when she was excited, Cloud Retainer would take on all kinds of different forms as she danced along with the gentle breeze.\nOn such occasions, the creatures of the mountains and rivers would raise their heads and prick up their ears, standing transfixed as they quietly enjoyed the blissful adeptal music. Other adepti too would stop to listen with gladness in their hearts.\nNowadays, a quietness has fallen upon Jueyun Karst, broken only by the whistle of the wind and the chirping of the birds.\nOccasionally, deep in the heart of Mt. Aocang, the sound of Cloud Retainer speaking with her disciples might be heard from the innermost recesses of her abode.\nOver the years, her compassion has driven her to take in many disciples. Some have tragic stories indeed, yet through years of assiduous training are no longer shrouded in melancholy, like buds that have weathered a frost emerging defiant from the melting snow.\nWatching them often brings her great joy. They embody the hopes that her friends once cherished, and thus through them their spirit lives on.\nThis is precisely why she's so protective of her young disciples. At times, her overflowing desire to care for them seems to overwhelm and confuse them — but she doesn't mind.\nAfter all, the young ones have never known the agony of being separated from their friends, nor beheld the sight of blood-soaked battlefields. How could they possibly know how much they meant to her? As long as they stay safe and sound, that's all that matters.\n<color=#ffd780>Jadevoid</color>\nLegend has it that the place where an adeptus resides is known as their Jadevoid. The adeptal abodes tucked away among the peaks of Jueyun Karst are just such places.\nThe word \"Jadevoid\" originates from a spot among the clouds high above Qingyun Peak which overlooks the world below. This is a place that has rarely been seen by mortal eyes.\n\"Jade\" refers to the foundation of this place, which was made from a single piece of Plaustrite — hence why it floats above the clouds.\nThe true way is found in emptiness, and thus can be attained by traversing the void. Once, those who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the trials of heaven and earth. This place served as the trial of \"heaven.\"\nOriginally, however, the Jadevoid was not created by the adepti as a test of the spirit. Instead, it was created by Cloud Retainer as a locale for reflection and meditation. It was only later that Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper persuaded her to lend this place for the benefit of those who might come seeking the adeptal path. Hearing that Rex Lapis had given his assent and that Guizhong and Streetward Rambler both agreed as well, Cloud Retainer readily gave up the Jadevoid and had a small pavilion built upon it.\nNowadays, few are able to follow the adeptal path, and the Jadevoid — almost nothing now but a legend among mortals — has returned to the care of Cloud Retainer. But today, returning to this place above the clouds, her state of mind has changed.\nThough the vast sea of clouds and the sight of the sun as it rises and sets are as magnificent as ever, her thoughts have begun to drift off to the lively bustle of the mortal world.\nNow, she yearns to live alongside the humans under the name of Xianyun.\n\"As it just so happens, I'm starting to feel hungry. How about... some of Wanmin Restaurant's delectable Crab Roe Tofu.\""

Seeing everyone cooped up in their abodes with nothing to do, one created a Snowdrift Mechanism for skiing on the mountains. One was having a tremendous time of it along with Guizhong and Streetward Rambler... until, of course, Moon Carver noticed as much and decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snow bank. It took us hours to dig him out... Later, one introduced a great many safety features to the mechanism, to the point where it could be safely piloted by even a three-year-old child.
