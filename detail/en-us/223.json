They use this elemental ability to further enhance their physical state, such as to protect themselves or increase the brute force of their attacks â€” a combination making them nearly unstoppable.\nThese powerful Hilichurls are called \"Lawa\" by the rest of the tribe, a respectful form of address best translated to mean \"king\" or \"chief\". However, Lawa don't actually rule over or lead the tribe at all. Rather, these large loners prefer solitude, avoiding the looks of reverence from the smaller Hilichurls.\nAdventurers very rarely encounter these gigantic creatures. Still, even the most seasoned adventurers will think twice before going on expeditions into areas where these dangerous Lawas may be roaming."
