Let's get closer and have a look.\nQuest Objective: Go to the building up ahead\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> The five symbols on this big door must be the Key Sigils.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Let's have a look around. From what we've experienced in the past, we'll probably need to do something else first.\nQuest Objective: Investigate the nearby area and search for clues\nQuest Objective: Investigate the mechanism and activate the gate\nQuest Objective: Examine the great gate and look for a way to progress\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Seems like there's something else visible through this door. Is it a path? Or is it a trap that'll make us bump into a wall?\nQuest Objective: Investigate the hidden path\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Huh, so there really was a path here. Enkanomiya is such a mysterious place.\nQuest Objective: Go to the door\nQuest Objective: Use the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep to open the door\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Looks like this is where we need to use the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep.\nQuest Objective: Open the door\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Wow! Paimon never thought that there'd be such a huge place underneath Watatsumi Island!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Looks like our goal is that place in the middle.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Alrighty then, Traveler. Let's head in. Steadily now...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Those ruins seem to be closer to us. Let's start there!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Buildings means people... once upon a time, anyway. And where there's people, there'll be writing!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> And where there's writing and paper, there'll be those... hints that we can't even read."
