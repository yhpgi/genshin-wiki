We're sure to uncover some rich vein of ore or trove of treasure!\"\n\"Indeed, Kau Kau, and when we do, our deeds will be recorded on woven scrolls.\"\nOnce upon a time, these two youths from the People of the Springs had sworn to explore all of Natlan.\nTo them, adventures and victories were a duty bestowed by the Wayob,\nWhile stories of mysterious islands and heroes of yore filled their hearts and minds.\nAnd so the young adventurers set out on their journey to perform a pilgrimage on foot.\nBut legends of bygone heroes seldom record the troubles that afflict ordinary people,\nAnd the world contains far fewer treasures than it does intrepid explorers.\nThe ore they dug up was mostly ordinary, the crystals they uncovered, humdrum even amongst mundanities.\nBut what of it? Their joy remained undimmed, and by the light of their nighttime bonfires, they held up the rocks they had collected.\nThey recalled the scenes and the sentiments they had experienced when they found them.\nThis one was taken from beneath the claws of a giant Tepetlisaurus while they were passing through crystal-filled mountains.\nWhile this one was the vicious fiend that tripped them by the edge of a natural hot spring when they were drunk.\nThis stone, covered in ashes, had once stood lengthy vigil on the edge of an ancient city, burned to ash.\nThere it had remained until the two travelers passed by and took it for themselves, paying no mind to the gray sentinel's wishes.\nAnd now, as the forger of stone takes each one and melts it down, the past stirs once more — brought back to life with each memory spoken.\nWhen they learned that Akamai's descendant wished to emulate their forebear, they chose to use these rocks as materials.\nThey would forge a blade to protect the scion soon to travel, for they knew only too well the dangers that lurked within the world.\nWhen the great blade was forged, Akamai and Kau Kau handed it to the would-be wanderer as a parting gift.\n\"Let the memories of the past accompany you on your journey, in place of forebears who now lack the strength to...\"\n\"The past flows through the blood into each new generation, like an unquenchable fire passed down through rituals that never cease to burn.\""
