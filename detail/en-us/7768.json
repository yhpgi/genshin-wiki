Our previous plan to drink Fire-Water together upon your return seems impossible now.\nI left some food in secret. It should be enough in the short run. Take as much as you need.\nSorry, as your friend, I can't do much other than this. The next time we meet, we shall become enemies.\nAlthough I am aware that you and your mission have nothing to do with what happened on the ground, please understand that we can never forgive such blatant act of invasion.\nJust as you fight for the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya, as one of the Millelith, I must protect our homeland. We each have our responsibility to shoulder for what we cherish.\nBest of luck to you. Yours sincerely, Yanbo."
