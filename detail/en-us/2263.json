Yet, judging by that ever-present grin, you can hardly tell if he is actually there working.\nFunnily enough, all his \"unorthodox behaviors as a public servant\" are somewhat acquiesced to.\nHis colleagues are more than willing to work with him and his boss seldom criticizes him for being this unfettered.\nEven his boss's boss inquires after him every now and then.\nAll this can be safely chalked up to his unrivaled prowess as a detective.\nWhenever the Tenryou Commission is tackling an unusually complicated case, be it a major one or a mysterious one, everyone regards Heizou as their last hope to crack the code.\nEven the head of the Police Station marvels at his extensive experience in solving cases, but Heizou himself has a different opinion about that.\n\"Experience is another name for people's past mistakes, and that's not my trump card.\"\n\"My trump card is something I was born with.\""

Not only do you have to pass the ability test, but also a thorough background check.\nTherefore, candidates are usually required to declare some essential information, such as any valuable property.\nAccording to Yoriki Owada, who was in charge of the check at the time, when Heizou applied, he handed in nothing but a blank declaration form.\nIt was a bright and sunny morning. Sitting opposite Owada, Heizou was curiously exploring the place with his eyes. Owada, who had been around the block by then, spent a moment deciphering the blank form, then looked up and insinuated,\n\"I've met many brilliant young people. However, it's a shame that none of them made it to the Station in the end.\"\nHearing this, all of a sudden, that seemingly hyperactive young man stopped looking around, sat up straight, and looked Owada in the eye.\n\"Right. How about a young person like me?\"\nHis switching happened so fast that Yoriki Owada was suddenly stunned, feeling like prey in the sights of some hawk-eyed predator.\nOut of nowhere, a strange sensation came over him, as if at that moment, he was the one being scrutinized.\nHe said jokingly then, as though it would steady his nerves,\n\"The Tenryou Commission does not discriminate against the poor. But if you have literally nothing to declare, then we'll make sure we pay extra attention to your background.\"\nIt was followed by an unexpected silence. The one sitting opposite looked straight at him without saying a word, just as before.\nOwada wasn't feeling his best, his forehead slightly twitching. Maybe it was too hot. He made to wipe off the sweat with the back of his hand.\nHowever, there was no sweat on his forehead at all. Owada stared blankly at the dry back of his hand, not knowing if he should wipe again or put his hand down.\nThe young man burst out into laughter upon seeing this. His hearty laughter immediately relieved Owada from his overwhelmed state.\nHeizou just leaned on the table with his chin in one hand, pointing to his head with the other. He smiled at Owada and said,\n\"Other than my genius, I have nothing to declare.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 3</color>\nThe Tenryou Commission is in fact not where Heizou started his career as a detective.\nBefore all this happened, Heizou once owned an agency called \"Bantan Sango & Heizou Detective Agency.\"\nIt was what was to become Bantan Sango Detective Agency in Inazuma City now, which was actually co-founded by Heizou and Sango in the beginning.\nThe story of the two started with them striking an instant chord with each other, only to end with them regretfully parting ways.\nAfter the breakdown of their partnership, Heizou's name, naturally, was taken down from the old business.\nAs for the reason behind it all, it can probably all be summed up as \"they had different visions.\"\nSango believes that a detective's entire mission is to uncover the truth, which is something of utmost significance. Most detectives also hold this belief dear to their hearts.\nBut Heizou reckons there's more to it. That there might be something that's even more vital than the truth.\nYears of experience working as a detective have made him aware that when a new case comes to him, that means something unfortunate has already happened.\nNo matter how the criminals are punished for their evil conduct afterward, it cannot change the fact that someone has already been hurt.\nSimilarly, no matter how skilled a doctor is, they will never be able to treat a patient and pretend that nothing ever happened, telling them,\n\"Look, all your wounds have healed, as if you were never wounded in the first place.\"\nThe truth is from then on, whenever the patient sees a doctor, sees an infirmary, or sees the scars left by the operation, they will be reminded every time of all the wounds that were once on their body, hurting them.\nDoctors are helpless to prevent violent actions from being executed somewhere. Detectives cannot stop new cases from emerging. But Heizou hopes to break this status quo once and for all.\n\"If I can't nip evil in the bud, then I shall be its natural enemy.\"\n\"The name of Shikanoin Heizou will be renowned throughout the world and intimidate anyone with malicious intent all across Teyvat.\"\n\"They will realize one thing. Once they submit to the darkness, I will hunt them down to the ends of the earth.\"\nIt was at that point that he made his decision to leave the agency and join the Tenryou Commission.\nIt was the starting point for him to become the \"detective\" he seeks to be."

Can I be your assistant? I'm very clever.\"\nHeizou eyed this chirpy young man up with a grin, then rubbed his chin and replied,\n\"My intuition tells me that you are not that clever.\"\n\"Huh? May... maybe your intuition is wrong.\"\nThe sentence Uesugi just uttered seemed to have some magic to it as if it were a closing joke made at the end of a comedy. On hearing that, his nearby senior colleagues all laughed like a supportive audience.\nThe clever Uesugi immediately realized that he had said something inappropriate, so he tried to patch his statement up.\n\"What I meant is... we can't just rely solely on intuition in our line of work!\"\nUnexpectedly, everyone laughed even harder this time. Uesugi, not comprehending what had happened, thought to himself that maybe he should really consider being a comedian.\nAt that moment, Heizou brushed his shoulder as if to remove the awkwardness along with the dust.\n\"I was just joking. Actually, my intuition tells me that you, Uesugi, are going to be an excellent Doushin.\"\n\"And so, I suggest that you find your own assistant should you have the time.\"\nNo sooner had Heizou finished his sentence than he had run away like the wind, leaving a still-baffled Uesigi and his guffawing colleagues behind.\n...\n\"You've still got a long way to go before you can be Doushin Shikanoin's assistant.\"\n\"I was just trying to help since I noticed that he has no assistant...\"\n\"Of course he does. He mentioned his assistant many times.\"\n\"What?! Has he?\"\n\"Didn't you hear him say 'my intuition tells me' multiple times?\"\n\"Huh?! Are you saying... that his assistant is... his intuition?!\"\n\"Exactly! That guy can solve cases merely with his intuition. Isn't that wild?\""

What's the difference?\"\nHeizou laughed, \"Cuz, I'm talking about the number of hairs on my hands!\"\n\"Just like we have no hair on our palms, none of the inmates can name all the Yoriki.\"\n\"But the inmates who can name me are as many as the hairs on the back of my hand!\"\n\"Now that my influence has far exceeded that of those Yoriki, what's in it for me to get promoted?\"\n\"On the contrary, staying close to the front line means that more criminals will be intimidated by the name of Shikanoin Heizou — that's my ultimate goal.\"\n\"So don't worry about me, cuz.

But is instead the name of Doushin Shikanoin Heizou.\nHere, at least, even the name of the Raiden Shogun herself might be lesser in stature compared to his.\nAfter all, none of these criminals, great or small, have ever been personally nabbed by the Shogun, but a great many of them are surely here on Heizou's account.\nThis is how things panned out:\nIt started with some arrogant crooks boasting while temporarily out from behind bars of how elite their criminal skills were and how they had sent government officials off on wild goose chases, seeking to gain the admiration of their fellows.\nBut when asked why they were caught in spite of their great skills, they would often blame, through clenched teeth, the matter on \"that detective.\"\n\"Not that I didn't try, mind you, but he's just too cunning!\"\nThus did the detective's name spread throughout the prison.\nEven later on, the situation would again change when the criminals discovered that the detective who caught them was someone named \"Shikanoin Heizou.\"\nIt was one thing if a single detective could catch some skilled crooks. Perhaps he was just a good detective.\nBut if countless high-level criminals were seized by this one man, then surely he could not be an ordinary person.\nIn that moment, everyone present imagined something similar.\nA trickster god in the guise of humanity, scheming and cunning beyond compare, seeing into the hearts of mortals with contemptuous ease.\nWhy, a change of sides would see such a fellow become the greatest criminal in history!\nThose who were unwilling to take part in further affray spoke no more, while even the most hardened and wicked amongst them secretly thought:\n\"It might be best not to take him on, or to speak more ill about him than we should.\"\nEven the fiercest criminal lords no longer use his name even when they wish to boast, instead using the pseudonym \"Cyclone.\"\nWhen the Doushin on guard duty heard this new title, they would ask what it meant.\nAnd some petty criminals would reply, \"A calamity! A plague upon all us crooks!\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4</color>\nThe way Heizou sees it, detectives are to destroy their opponents' defenses using their intelligence.\nUsing force to subdue criminals is, inevitably, the inferior way of doing things, and so Heizou does his best to avoid this in his daily work.\nAs such, his reputation at the Police Station was, for the longest time, one of a brainy but dainty character.\nThus, everyone was all too sure that he would be in for a tough time at the internal martial arts contest held by the Station.\nThis would be a no-holds-barred contest: neither limitations on schools nor restrictions of weapons would hold any sway here. The only rule was that the one to knock their opponent from a fifty-pace ring would triumph.\nTo everyone's shock, however, the \"brainy\" Heizou would show up to this contest without using Vision, and he carried no weapon but his two bare fists, which in turn carried him to the final.\nDuring that match, Kujou Sara, who had arrived upon hearing rumors of his prowess, assessed that the match was over even before it began.\n\"Doushin Shikanoin moves lightly and his fists are the match of any weapon. It would be hard to match him in melee — and only a skilled bowman would triumph.\"\nAs she predicted, Heizou's opponent would concede defeat after taking seventeen punches to the left side, with only a streak of Heizou's hair sliced off to show for it.\nBut just as he was about to be crowned champion, Kujou Sara herself walked into the ring and picked up a training bow, requesting a match with Heizou.\nThere was a brief uproar. Most of the people participating in the tournament were rather junior Doushin, and no one had expected that General Kujou herself would attend.\nHeizou narrowed his eyes. He had originally only come to test his skills, such that he might not be found wanting in the extreme situations where his wits alone would not be sufficient.\nBut at this moment, his blood was up and the spirit of competition had descended on him like it often does on youths, and so he gladly accepted. In a flash, the atmosphere heated up and everyone was flushed with excitement.\n\"Great going, Heizou!\" Doushin Uesugi yelled from the stands, Yoriki Owada quietly pumping a fist from beside him.\nAfter a moment's preparation, both parties entered the ring. The rules were slightly different this time: neither of them would use their Visions. This would only be a contest at fifty paces between Sara's arrow and Heizou's fists. Whoever touched the other first with their weapon would be declared the victor.\nThe atmosphere by now was practically bursting at the seams. The battle was about to begin. Yet few realized that in a battle between experts, each move was peril itself, and that the match would be ended in a single shot.\nSara let fly, and fifty paces away, Heizou was seen with his right hand clenched in front of his chest, tightly gripping an arrow that quivered but two finger-widths from his heart like a striking serpent.\n\"It's my loss. What a frighteningly fast shot,\" Heizou said with a laugh, before throwing the arrow aside. \"There was no time to evade, General, so I was forced to touch your weapon.\"\n\"I won by dint of the rules alone. I have met very few who could catch one of my arrows barehanded. I doubt the result would be so certain, were this a real battle.\"\nSara's eyes glimmered as she spoke such praise.\n\"Doushin Shikanoin, you are skilled in both mind and hand. You will do great things, should you be more disciplined.\"\n...\nHalf a month later, a champion's medal specially made by the Tenryou Commission arrived at the Grand Narukami Shrine, along with a handwritten note.\n\"Here's a little something, cuz, for you to give to my old man when you've got the time. Y'know, just to let him know that I haven't completely made a mess of his teachings and all.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 6</color>\nHeizou mentions his childhood very little, for it was not a happy one.\nHe was born in a remote village where his ancestry was rather prominent and his father was a martial artist of some small repute.\nBut just like every other rebellious child in the world, he only wished to escape having to take up his father's work, even as he was forced to learn martial arts alongside him.\nThis state of affairs would persist until Heizou made a friend who claimed to be from a wealthy merchant family at a festival.\nThis friend was a bright and agile mind, and would often bring all manner of new gadgets for Heizou to play with, saying that they were from his family's storehouse.\nBooks from Sumeru, mysterious toys from Fontaine of all sorts... These toys injected significant vibrance into Heizou's otherwise monotonous life.\nThe friends grew closer as they grew older, but Heizou also began to notice a problem.\nHis friend's clothes were always filthy, hardly the sort of image a rich merchant's son should have.\nHe thus decided to have an honest talk with his friend. They would have a conversation like proper adults.\nUnexpectedly, his friend immediately admitted to having deceived him, and even confessed that all the gifts he had given Heizou were stolen from the local merchant's guild.\nHe even went so far as to relate that he had originally met Heizou at the festival with the intention to steal some valuables from the latter, only for them to have become friends instead.\nHe laughed as he confessed these matters, as if this was some interesting tale.\nHeizou was furious, though he knew not what he was angry at: was he angry at having been deceived by his best friend? Or was it because his best friend was a criminal?\nRegardless, he reprimanded his friend harshly: \"We're not friends anymore!\"\nFuming, he returned home, sought out each and every item he had been given, and threw them all out, till nothing but a single green pebble remained.\nThis was one of a pair of \"treasures\" the two of them had fished out from a small stream, and each of them had taken one. This item alone was not tainted by theft, and was perhaps purer even than their friendship.\nGazing upon it, Heizou hardened his heart and threw it out the window... only for it to strike the window lattice and come flying back, rolling under his bed.\nNow irate, and seeing how even the heavens were conspiring against him in this endeavor, Heizou, in a fit of growing pique, dumped himself on the ground like a frog with a punctured belly, refusing to move.\nLooking at the ceiling despondently, he told himself that he would one day put these ill things out of his mind. Yet the world is such that the more we wish to forget things, the more they shall refuse to be forgotten.\nA year later, when the festival where he and his friend first met rolled back around, Heizou happened to rediscover the pebble, and had it on him as he traveled to attend the festival.\nHe knew not what he was expecting, but fate already had an answer on hand... though it was not the one Heizou expected.\nHeizou would meet his friend again that day, collapsed by the roadside in a pool of his own blood amidst the screams of the crowd.\nJust a moment earlier, his friend had gotten into an altercation with a ruffian who had angled to steal his Mora purse, and who then in a panic had plunged a dagger into his heart.\nHeizou dashed over to check on his old friend, the pebble in his hand falling by the wayside. Catching sight of it, his friend's dull eyes lit up just a little.\n\"Come here to see me, did you... Heizou?\"\nHeizou tried to keep pressure over his good friend's chest, but the blood kept seeping through his fingers, and he was again filled with fury, even more so than the year prior.\n\"Just shut up! Shut up!\" He yelled at his friend.\nHis friend shook his head, and with great effort opened his purse. There was not a single Mora inside — nothing but the green pebble that had belonged to him.\nSqueezing the last ounce of his strength out, he held the pebble out to Heizou with a smile broader than when they had parted.\n\"I... I came to see you, too...\"\n...\nHeizou did not recall how he had returned home. His mind was blank, filled with nothing but rage and disgust.\nBut in that moment, his intuition told him that he felt rage and disgust at a certain thing, and that he and it had always been foes.\nThis thing had mixed deception into friendship, and it had caused life to be cut short before its time. \"Sin.\" That was its name.\nBut it was not his friend's sin of deception or theft, nor was it the murder that the thief committed. It was something more abstract, something of a higher order.\nIt was the culmination of all the sins in this world, hovering over all like a titanic shadow covering the skies, fixing its cold and unfeeling gaze on all that was good in this world, and seeking ways to snuff it out.\nOne morning, one month later, Heizou sneaked out of doors to travel afar, leaving a farewell note behind. He had found his enemy, and he would now embark on a journey to make war against it.\nAccompanying him on this journey was a green stone, but it was not the pebble that symbolized friendship, but instead a Vision that stood for his resolve."

Meanwhile, that one seems very troubled about their \"injured hand,\" and they're wearing a pair of \"brand-new shoes that don't match their well-worn attire\"...
