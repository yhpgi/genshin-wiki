As expected, the technology of Ochkanatlan, the Cinder City, is not so easily replicated.\nThe floating device, bereft of the Relic's support, fell quickly. Is that a power output issue or a weight issue?\nIt seems that we'll have to rely on components obtained from Cinder City for the time being.\n...\nLog No. 120:\nThose blasted, brutish boors! How dare they question my ideals!\nIt's just a few smashed workshops! If we cannot even take such a minuscule risk, how can we ever surpass our predecessors!?\nHmph. Whatever. The Relic remains within my possession. As long as I continue my research, I will surely make progress...\n...\nLog No. 133:\nEven Father and Puma refuse to support me now... Put up to it by those vulgarians in the tribe, I'm sure!\nHmph. But so what? So what if no one in this world supports me? I have my own \"ways\"...\nIt is time to leave this place. My dream is the entire sky itself.\n..."
