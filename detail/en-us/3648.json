We have made some gains, especially with regard to the tribespeople of the desert encampment, who are willing to hand a young woman over to us for experimentation. This alone might be considered sufficient progress.\nOur other objective, however, cannot be achieved through dealings with this tribe, so we shall cease negotiations at this time and perform several internal personnel transfers. Secrecy must be maintained at all times. We cannot risk raising an unnecessary commotion.\nThe codes to be used to confirm the identity of the units and personnel being transferred are as follows. Remember them well, so as to avoid any infiltration on the part of the tribespeople.\n(The codes below have been blurred by water. Only some incomplete words remain...)\n\"Ice Cream\"... \"Igor L...\" \"No Tracks\"... \"Gerardo\"...\n... \"Ravioli\"..."
