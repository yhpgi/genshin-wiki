This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.\nThe current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.\nThe meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead."

Their expressions were strange, all on account of her overly-young appearance in their eyes.\nPlots were hatched and questions were endless. The ambitious planned to make their move. The storm was approaching, and all was not at peace on Watatsumi Island.\nYet all went back to business as usual not long after Kokomi ascended to her position.\nShe was fair in distributing rewards and punishments alike, appreciated the contributions of the people, and was militarily skilled. Her many abilities quickly won the hearts of most of the people.\n\"Things will be alright as long as Her Excellency is here\" soon became the most widespread saying on the island."

She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.\nHaving ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.\nHowever, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.\nAs such, Kokomi set up an \"energy\" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.\nWhen she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.\nEngrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.\nThese moments are of utmost value to her."

Instead, she respects the will of the people and wishes that they can each find their own way.\nJust as the vast ocean can accommodate countless souls and their individual desires, so does Kokomi wish her rule could be.\nWhen the Vision Hunt Decree came about, the resentment of the people turned into cries of revolt, and so Kokomi led them in raising the banner of resistance.\nAnd once the war was over, the hearts of the people turned towards peace and stability, and so did Kokomi direct her energies towards governance and economics.\nBut what was the source of this toil? Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?\nAs the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision. And ever since the day she looked out at the sea outside Sangonomiya Shrine, her wish has never once changed—\n\"I wish to protect all of Watatsumi Island and allow its people to lead happy lives.\""

Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship...</p>",

If I'm not mistaken, he got along very well with Gorou — they would often fight side-by-side in battle. Kazuha has a carefree personality and doesn't like constraints, but he would follow every command to the letter when he was among our ranks. In my opinion, not only is he an outstanding swordsman, but a very refined character.</p>",

Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island.

If you are ever deployed to the battlefield together, be sure to have a good rein on him when things get underway.\n<color=#ffd780>About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Duties</color>\nAs the leader of Watatsumi Island, Her Excellency is responsible for assessing the scenario and formulating a plan. It is then my duty to put every detail of the plan into action and to keep the situation under control on the front line. We are united with the whole resistance in achieving a single purpose: victory.\n<color=#ffd780>About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Attitude</color>\nI have only the utmost respect for Her Excellency. Without her ingenious and insightful strategies, the resistance could never have come as far as it has today. But if you ask me, it seems that deep down she prefers a much quieter existence. So when there's no pressing military matters, I try not to disturb her too much.\n<color=#ffd780>More About Gorou: IV</color>\nHer Excellency once warned me of my fatal flaw... I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?"

A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed \"detective\" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself.\n<color=#ffd780>About Sangonomiya Kokomi</color>\nI've actually never seen Madam Sangonomiya before. Whenever she appears, practically the whole village crowds around her... I'm not about to contend with that. Oh, and even if you made it through all the villagers, there'd still be a circle of shrine maidens around her! For one of us young people to gain that kind of recognition from everyone, it must have taken a lot of work."
