After their mother is murdered and the crime is covered up, they flee but vow to avenge her. The siblings become skilled musketeers, and years later, they systematically take revenge on the baron's family members to reveal the truth about their mother's death and bring justice to her memory.

After filming, Chevreuse initiated the murder investigation, focusing on locations related to musket activity in the Fleuve Cendre. The investigation revealed some clues, but Chevreuse suggested continuing the investigation after completing the film, expecting new leads to emerge with time.

Originally, people commemorated the Lochknights by imitating them, wearing special costumes, raising golden cups, and going door to door requesting pure water. However, Lady Furina made the tradition more festive a few years ago by changing the water request to sweets. The festival is considered to be more carnival-like now and is popular among children who engage in \"trial or treat\" activities each year which include going door-to-door asking for candies with baskets during the celebration.

        "text": "A legend says that Knight Erinnyes* of the Lakelight was the Chief of Lochknights, who worshiped the Mistress of Many Waters, Egeria. She defeated the princes of Bellouacoi, Atrebatis, and Uiromanduoi, and accepted their allegiance. And so the residents of those lands submitted to her rule with sincerity. They swore to find the Pure Grail and to free the Mistress of Many Waters from her imprisonment to atone for the sin they had borne since birth.\nLegend has it that the Pure Grail was a sacred vessel with the Primordial Water that can grant any wish. The Golden Grail could wipe away all the tears of the future, make the heirs of the high sea never again to suffer the pain and sorrow of the past, cure even the most terrifying of wounds, restore youth, and revive the dead. Only the purest of people can behold its glory, obtaining eternal life and wisdom unending.\nTo celebrate that fealty and wisdom, eight days of feasting were ordered by Erinnyes in Aremori Castle. An emissary dispatched by King Remus of Capitolium joined the celebration to relay a message from the God King Remus. He asked for two gifts: water, for the purest of waters can wash away all sins, and earth, for dense earth can resist the erosion that looms. If Erinnyes would resist, death shall be sure to follow.\nThe wise Knight Erinnyes refused to bow before King Remus and told the emissary that she was to lead the blessed army of the Mistress of Many Waters to destroy the grand city, and to cleanse Remus's army in their own blood. She ordered wondrous gifts for the Capitoliani musician and sent him back to the Golden City.\nLegends say that Erinnyes's home was destroyed early on by the wrathful God King, with an army from the Golden City enslaving or killing her family. Only two were to escape that fate. One met with the proud Harmost during the war and ultimately rose to inherit his authority. The other received the grace of the Mistress of Many Waters and was taken in by the Prince of Aremorica, to guard those pure waters not yet seized by the God King.\nOne legend says that when sin tempted the City of Eternity to its fall, the Lochknights faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known. But in the end, the heartfelt longing of the people reached the heavens. Then, thanks to their pure hearts and the Pure Grail obtained through countless sacrifices, the Mistress of Many Waters was freed from imprisonment and restored.\nErinnyes thanked the Mistress of Many Waters for showing her the Pure Grail and for allowing her to complete this journey. She promised that the surviving Lochknights would continue to loyally serve Egeria and her future kingdom, following that noble musician, and that they would pursue the lingering shadows, restoring justice. The knight with sea-colored eyes confessed her sins and asked to comfort her soul in expulsion and exile. The Mistress of Many Waters kindly granted the knight’s wish. The Mistress of Many Waters gave a flower as pure as Lakelight to the last Lochknight as a farewell gift. To this day, Fontaine maintains the tradition of picking a Lily and giving it to those on long journeys, wishing one another a road ahead as tranquil as pure water, and that those most precious will be able to follow its cool light, returning to their side.\nTo ask for mercy from the Mistress of Many Waters and return the holy sword, Erinnyes threw her sword, Hauteclaire, into the waters of the lake. On the third time, the Sword of Light sank without a trace. And then she left with her head held high, never again to be seen by any in this world.\nAnother version of the legend says that when sin tempted the City of Eternity to its fall, a singer named Erinnyes faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known. Yet, she remained unable to find that Pure Grail. But it was the heavens who chose the Mistress of Many Waters, commanding her to return from her primeval prison to take over from the golden king and rule the sea-ruins.\nErinnyes said:"

In the script of the people of bygone times, the symbol for the sound \"gh\" looks quite similar to \"y,\" and so was copied as such. There is precedent for similar mistakes. The proper pronunciation of the name should be \"Errighenth of Aremorica\" — in the language of the people of bygone times, \"Er\" signifies \"high\" while \"Righenth\" would be the feminine case of \"ruler.\" From this perspective, the name is perhaps not her praenomen, but rather her title. However, since many scholars already refer to her as \"Erinnyes,\" this \"name\" remains in history.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
