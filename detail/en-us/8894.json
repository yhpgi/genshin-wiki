It's not every day you hear of mercenaries willing to spend that kind of money on raising a child... And if the rumors are true, the power in her gauntlets has some ties to King Deshret, too... That's life in the desert of Sumeru for you. Things that seem completely unrelated turn out to be connected by unseen threads — and then one day, when people least expect it, the tangled web of complexity bursts out into the open.<br>Anyway, it sounds like Dehya's done pretty well for herself.

In just a few more days, she would set off for the Akademiya with their representative and begin a brand-new chapter in her life.\nThough the future felt too vast for the young Nefer to grasp, and she had no way of knowing which path she would eventually take, she was more than happy to lose herself in a whirlwind of imagined possibilities.\nIt'd be best if she could end up at Amurta — she was a perfect fit for their research, with how easily she could identify desert flora and fauna. If not... well, Kshahrewar was an option too. The mechanical sciences seemed pretty interesting, and besides, she was nifty with her hands. Maybe that wouldn't be a bad fit either. As for Spantamad... forget it. She didn't have a Vision, so manipulating elemental energy was out of the question. Doing research there would be a total pain, she was sure of it. What other places were there again? Oh... there was still Haravatat, Rtawahist...\nNefer gradually fell asleep, cocooned in those fantastic thoughts. In her past dreams, she would sometimes find herself back in that dark cellar, hands over her ears, not daring to breathe lest she was discovered. But always, the door would swing open violently, and she would see that sword, stained dark red, come down on her... And then, she would wake up, screaming.\nBut now her dreams were filled with all those wonderful Darshans, so much so that there was no room left for the shadows of her past.\nYet reality was like a pit of desert quicksand, and imagination was but another thing for it to swallow whole.\n\"...Nefer? Oh, the one from the desert... You've been assigned to Vahumana.\"\nSuch was the scholar's pronouncement as he looked down at her.\n\"But I haven't taken the test to determine which Darshan I should go to yet.\"\n\"The test? That's not necessary. Just go there with your books now.\"\n\"...\"\nThe scholar's response was cold and guarded. Indeed, he was expecting a protracted argument with the girl.\n\"I understand.\"\nThe student from the desert nodded her head, picked up her books, and walked silently towards her future.\nAll the pompous justifications the scholar had prepared caught in his throat. Now his breathing felt a little more difficult, if anything.\n\"...Tsk, desertfolk.\"\n...In any case, a single drop of water had slipped through the cracks in the Akademiya's grand edifice, falling towards the desert.\nFor a desert dweller like her, it was already more than enough.\n...\nAnother researcher frowned as he watched the girl walk away.\n\"That assignment was far too arbitrary. Every student admitted to the Akademiya has the right to sit for the test.\"\n\"I'm just following the rules, Cyrus. Now don't go making trouble for yourself. Admitting one of the desertfolk is already...\"\n\"From where I'm standing, I can't see if she's from the desert or the rainforest. All I see is a student who's here at the Akademiya to learn...\"\n\"...Fine, fine. Now keep your voice down, unless you want trouble from Azar's ilk.\""

A letter to a friend had but only begun.\n\"Dear Candace, I have begun my studies at the Akademiya...\"\nNefer's pen paused mid-stroke as she hesitated, unsure of what to write next.\nShe searched her mind, only to recall the questions from her classmates — some asked with pointed intent, others not quite so.\n\"Are the desertfolk always fighting each other? And if yes, why? The ancient texts say it's mostly over money and water. Is that really so?\"\n\"Is it true that the desertfolk can't count? I heard that it was the Akademiya who sent people to teach them math.\"\n\"What do your people eat? Heh, I heard that desertfolk often drink animal blood, and that's how they've been able to survive in the desert all this time. Is that true?\"\n...\nThese students, who have never been touched by any sort of hardship, have never seen me as a peer, let alone as an equal human being.\nTo them, I'm nothing more than a curiosity, an object to be gawked at. The only reason I'm allowed to exist here is because they need someone to use as a footstool.\nI've tried explaining, yelling, presenting every piece of evidence, and I've dug up every story from the depths of my heart, all just to prove that we aren't the \"desertfolk\" they imagine us to be.\n...I think that perhaps I should return to Aaru Village. There is no place for me here at the Akademiya. I miss you too, Candace...\n...\nUnfortunately, the paper material was too thin to carry these heartfelt words of hers, and she was forced to confine her message to only what was appropriate and proper.\nNefer continued writing, choosing instead to focus on the Akademiya and the differences between its various Darshans, the delicious food and other curious tales to be heard in Sumeru City, and the magnificent Grand Bazaar...\nFinally, these \"words from the heart\" came to a comforting conclusion.\n\"...I've made a new friend who's very interested in incense. I'll introduce her to you when I get the chance.\"\n\"Yours faithfully, Nefer.\""

According to the so-called \"middleman,\" the girl was a rising star in Nod-Krai, as clever and cunning as a viper...\nTch. That \"Middleman\" would make any boast for the right amount of coin. This kid? She wouldn't last a month in Nod-Krai...\n\"I've taken care of the debt you asked me to collect.\"\nThe self-proclaimed \"veteran\" of a treasure hunter froze as a dark red coin pouch landed abruptly in front of her.\n...She'd never told the girl what she had hired her to do.\n\"And now, it's time for you to pay what you owe.\"\nThe treasure was dazed for a brief moment, but that was enough for the viper to strike and sink its fangs into its prey's neck.\nThe treasure hunter's life and strength slipped away before her instincts could even kick in. In short order, this depraved beast had met its end.\nThe dispossessed desert dweller slowly let exhaled as the one who had been waiting outside the room stepped in without a sound.\n\"Miss Nefer, the others have also been eliminated according to plan. This was the last one.\"\nNefer nodded. This infamous treasure hunter was the last \"leader\" she had to eliminate.\nOnce upon a time, Nod-Krai was ruled by these so-called \"leaders\" who, behind closed doors, carved the land up into individual spheres of influence. Like the tyrants and usurpers that some exiles far from home had fled, they had quietly seized this Elysium, which by rights belonged to all, and unleashed their pawns to commit acts of brutality at will.\nBut Nefer knew that those seemingly loyal minions also nursed ambitions of sinking their own fangs into those who sat enthroned.\nOnce the king of these beasts was discovered dead in her room, those dreams that once seemed illusory would now have a chance to become reality.\nThen they would fight, devour, and plunder, tearing each other apart even as the flames of ambition scorched their own flesh, all to forge a crown from bone and blood, a crown that would grant them power over all.\nAnd Nefer would shatter that crown with her own two hands the moment it appeared.\n\"...What should we do next, Miss Nefer?\"\n\"Wait,\" came the short and succinct answer from the leader of the assassins. \"We wait till daybreak and for the dust to settle...\"\nThe future owner of the Curatorium of Secrets contemplated the chaos surging in the palm of her hand, and then she spoke again.\n\"Bring more hands in to help. We don't want to drag innocent people into this.\"\n\"They will be my valued clients in the future, after all.\""

They would rather face caged monsters or some malicious spell, for at least then, there might be some real satisfaction to be had.\nAnd yet, whenever Miss Nefer receives them, she speaks in a tone most ordinary, calmly brewing tea as if she had never personally destroyed a gang, led a certain boss to ruin, or ever sparked conflict between any rival factions. As if she were not the unseen hand stirring the waters of Nod-Krai, keeping them just the right degree of murky...\nOnce, a trembling young man drew his blade against her. In his foolishness, he declared that no matter how meticulous a schemer Nefer was, she was still flesh and blood, and all he needed was one moment of reckless courage to bring her down...\nThe owner of the Curatorium paid no heed to the feeble threat. Instead, she commended him with a small smile. At the very least, he alone had followed his heart and dared to draw steel. The others before him had spoken of revenge, but in truth had hidden behind hollow bravado, hoping to use such posturing to bargain for petty profit.\nFor his foolish — yet admirable — show of bravery, Nefer was willing to tell the young man what kind of person could truly walk the path of victory.\nThere are indeed many powerful figures in Nod-Krai. Some command vast wealth, others possess fearsome reputations. Yet none of them can emerge as the ultimate victor.\nTheir names and fortunes have become shackles, making them hesitant and overly cautious, afraid that any wrong move might shatter some precious bauble. Furthermore, age has caught up with them, and they can sense death drawing near. The distractions they once ignored have returned with a vengeance, and now, night after night, they lie awake, haunted by memories and the looming shadow of their own end.\n\"Now, look at you. At least you still have your whole life ahead of you. That alone gives you the room to become more than ordinary.\"\nThen the owner of the Curatorium of Secrets smiled, and she offered the youth a commission with which he could potentially make a name and fortune for himself.\n\"Be honest with yourself. What do you think you can accomplish on your own?\"\n...\nAnother client had just left the Curatorium. Nefer closed the door, then poured some water into Ashru's bowl.\nShe crouched down and spoke to the cat, who remained in his own world as he drank.\n\"...Well, Ashru. Looks like we've just brought on another temp. They're brave, sure, but tied down with a ton of baggage. I doubt they'll make it very far.\"\n\"We seem to have gone through everyone in town, but there isn't anyone interesting enough, it seems...\"\n\"Meow meow? Meow, meow meow...\"\n\"What? I was late in filling your bowl today, you say? Hehe. Alright then, I'll see if I can find you someone full-time.\"\n\"Obviously, we can't have you going without water, so let's find you someone first, interesting or not.\"\n\"Meow! Meow meow!\""

Their unease about the Curatorium stemmed largely from an instinctive fear of the unknown.\nHowever, children don't tend to think that deeply. What they remember is how kind and pretty Big Sister Nefer is, with her lovely voice and gentle manner. They remember the candy she gave them and the fascinating stories she has told — stories that, while a little scary, were still far more entertaining than the adults' lectures.\n...The lady in green is the owner of the Curatorium of Secrets and is a good person, so... the Curatorium must be a good place, too!\nAs a result, the first ordinary client to visit the Curatorium was a tearful little girl who would only stop crying after being comforted by a certain permanent staff member there. In between sobs, she explained that her parents had said they were going out on business, but they hadn't come back. As such, she wanted to ask Miss Nefer to help find them.\nThe girl's small wish was quickly granted. Once the clues were found, the young lady with the metal arm acted swiftly and decisively, rescuing the couple from the bandits who had taken them captive. And when the time came for payment, Miss Nefer asked for only a single hairpin from the little girl's head.\nAnd this is how the first tender shoot sprouted.\nWord of the commission eventually spread through the little girl's vivid retellings. Little by little, people began to consider visiting, and one client after another found the courage to step into the once-mysterious building and pour out their troubles. Even the children would sometimes sneak in just to play with the lazy black cat, only to scatter in laughter the moment Big Sister Nefer returned.\nToday, the Curatorium is like a river winding around Nasha Town, a place where people come to draw water, to play, and sometimes to stumble upon small blessings along its banks...\nFor the unwitting common folk, their interactions with this river would end right here.\nOnly those who have truly ventured into its deeper waters know that tranquility and gentleness are a mere facade. In truth, this river has conquered all its tributaries, commanding them to merge their waters with its own. In its darkest depths, the merciless currents surge stronger than ever, dragging things that should never surface down to the bottom, burying them deep beneath mud and pebbles.\nOnly one person can uncover the river's true secrets.\n...\n\"Boss, can't you send Ashru to look for the cats next time? I don't speak cat, you know...\"\nThe girl with the metal arm bounced into the Curatorium with a pout on her face.\nNefer closed the ledger and watched as Ashru leaped onto the table, settling down and rolling over contentedly under the vigorous petting of the Curatorium's sole permanent employee.\n\"Tsk! You get to eat all this cat food every day without lifting a paw. Next time, I'm taking you out on field duty!\"\n\"Meow! Meow meow meow!\"\nThe sunlight outside the window was perfect. Surely, the river's surface would be shimmering and sparkling, dotted with people rowing boats and swimming, lost in moments of pure beauty and carefree joy...\nBut as for what lay beneath the water, no one would ever know."

Nefer's proposal, in truth, had exceeded his expectations. He had merely hoped the Curatorium's owner would help locate a certain traitor so that the appropriate punishment could be meted out. But at the meeting, he learned that she had already arranged for their target to visit the Curatorium for some business three days later, giving them the perfect opportunity to act. It was as if she had known his intentions all along.\nAnd as for Nefer's requested recompense, it was simply \"to have a chat with the person in charge.\"\nThe visitor thought of the aging representative, an influential figure at the Northern Intelligence Network who had long been searching for a successor. This visit to the Curatorium, this very deal, had been approved by him. Could it be that he had already—\nPerhaps this conversation between Nefer and the representative would lead to a change in leadership at the Network...\nThe emissary quietly pushed down certain thoughts that might stir up unnecessary trouble, offered his thanks to Nefer, and took his leave.\n...\nNefer caught the Moon Wheel that she had tossed high into the air as she watched the emissary depart.\nIt had appeared at the bottom of the box of gifts the emissary brought after their conversation. Amidst the pearls and the gold, this extraordinary item immediately caught her eye — it was something no mortal could have forged, and it certainly wasn't listed in the emissary's official inventory.\nBut what really made her pause to think was another story about the moon from the past.\nLong ago, she had held a conversation with the Lord of Lies within Aaru, and to this day, she still recalled how skilled that sycophant, the Ibis King, was at deception and persuasion. She still remembered how he boasted of laboring across three moons such that he might guide the benighted mortals below, weaving reasonable threads of fate for all living things, such that life on earth could sprout anew in cycles. He had also told her how, upon arriving in Sumeru, his talents were recognized by the discerning King Deshret. He claimed that he was then elevated to lead the great \"Seven Pillars of King Deshret,\" that he drank the wine of revelry with the king himself, and that he once planted greenery alongside the Goddess of Flowers. In short, if Nefer were to accept his grace, she would gain extraordinary power.\nNefer didn't believe these tales for a moment, absurd as they were. To her, they were nothing more than lies hastily spun by an old trickster trying to win her trust. After all, King Deshret had exiled three sycophantic courtiers to Aaru. Would it not have been all too easy for the trio, extraordinary as they nonetheless were, to come together in the time since and weave a story meant to deceive the unsuspecting?\n\"Will you truly refuse to believe anything?\" Thoth, inhabiting the cat’s body, asked angrily. The cat's fur bristled, not from conscious effort, but simply because cat fur naturally stands on end when they're upset.\n\"If a deity wishes to deceive people with their wisdom, the people will surely be deceived,\" Nefer responded with a shrug. \"So I won't believe a single word you say either.\"\n\"But the power you're about to give me? That's worth believing in,\" said the dispossessed desert dweller with a smile. \"Today, I own nothing, and as such, there's nothing else I can believe in.\"\n...\nNefer fiddled with the Moon Wheel with the slightest hint of a smile on her face.\n...It seemed there was a tiny bit of truth hidden somewhere in all of Thoth's lies.\nA moment later, she tossed this long-overdue gift into a document bag.\nThis extraordinary item should serve as a powerful deterrent at the meeting three days down the line."

Today, these legends' origins are long lost, and their veracity is impossible to prove. Yet the creatures that once walked with the light continue to watch over this land from the shadows, through the long frozen nights and withering black tide alike — none of which could cause their forms to vanish from this world.",
