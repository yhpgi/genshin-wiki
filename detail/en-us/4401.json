Of course, the price it pays for such capabilities and its cost of manufacture is that is unable to fully unleash its capabilities against smaller opponents.</p><p>Long ago, Fontaine was once scarred by the tragic invasion of a massive monster. The revered White Armada that sailed upon the great terrestrial lake was completely destroyed in defense of the nation. The designer hoped that were such a thing to happen again, the clockwork meka would possess enough naval firepower to be the first line of defense, going before the soldiers and generals.</p>",
