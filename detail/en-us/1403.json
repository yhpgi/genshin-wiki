The tofu, thread-thin as the autumn leaves, floats amidst the bowl, like mist in a forest, and the shredded bamboo shoots give the image a sweet, lustrous sheen, while the broth combines the essence of fowl and ham, giving off an unbelievable aroma. A single taste is enough to cause the customer to lose themselves in this fog of flavor.",
