Such mechanisms, which can be found throughout Enkanomiya, are connected to the Dainichi Mikoshi and can be used to modify the day-night cycle.\nEnkanomiya appears different in the Evernight and Whitenight states. Use this ability to switch between day and night well in order to uncover the land's secrets."
