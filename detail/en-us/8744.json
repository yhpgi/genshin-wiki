            "text": "Your Dime Eerie Mystery! The Master Thief Reed Miller and the Sampo Mill (Deluxe Quarterly Edition)\n(This inexpensive and entertaining story series, popular in Nasha Town, costs only 10 Mora per issue. Presumably, it's about the master thief Reed Miller's attempt to steal the Frostmoon relic, the Sampo Mill, from the governor's palace. However, in a seeming attempt to boost readership, the narrative is focusing on the many young women vying for Miller's affections instead.)\n...\nChapter IV\nWagtail, a beauty as dangerous as a hunting falcon, has appeared! She approaches master thief Reed Miller under the moonlight... but to what end?\nLeaving your lovely female companions behind to come enjoy the night view here? What a cad you are, my dear.\nThat soft voice is as smooth as the finest silk from Liyue, and yet beneath its surface lurks a subtle cruelty, sharp as the thorns of a Sumeru Rose. Reed Miller does not turn around, for he knows that voice all too well.\nA graceful figure lands beside him with the poise of a cat. A young woman in her twenties, with long lavender hair cascading over her pale, bare shoulders and neck. She wears an elegant silver evening gown that clings to her curves like liquid moonlight. Still, it cannot conceal the mockery in her brownish-red eyes.\nMeet Wagtail — or \"A,\" as she is known to a privileged few like Miller. She is the only femme fatale in Nod-Krai whose skill and infamy rival those of the most legendary thieves. Any treasure she sets her sights on is already hers; once the thrill is gone, she'll just as soon toss it to the poor in the streets as she might cast it into the sea. Countless men have vied for her affection, but she takes pleasure only in toying with their earnest feelings and has never returned the love of a suitor...\nThe only treasure Wagtail has been unable to steal is the heart of master thief Reed Miller. This one impossible feat drives her obsession with the handsome, enigmatic man, and she's tried every trick and gambit imaginable to make his heart hers and hers alone.\nI smell expensive perfume and cheap ambition, Wagtail.\nWith a smile on her lips, she smoothly settles down beside the thief, then almost imperceptibly sidles closer to him.\nIt was a gift from another man. Jealous? She lets a silk-gloved hand trail down his arm. \"As for me, I smell overconfidence, Reed. You've got your eye on the Sampo Mill, I'm sure. But isn't that a little... obvious of you?\"\nYou're right. I do want the Mill, which was stolen from the Frostmoon Scions, along with all the governor's other ill-gotten treasures. Miller finally meets Wagtail's gaze, sending an involuntary shiver running through her and a blush rising to her cheeks, which she forces down with a glib smile. \"This is my stage tonight. You'd better find your own.\"\nNonsense. She leans in, her lips a mere breath from his. \"This stage is big enough for two. The spotlight, however... That only shines on one. I'll have my hands on the Mill before you do, darling. And if you please me... I might even let you see it from afar.\"\nDing!\nThe words are barely out of Wagtail's mouth before she whips out a slender, sinister-looking dagger with lightning speed. She delights in the pointless and seemingly dangerous attack, knowing full well Miller will block it, and indeed he does, by simply raising his arm and deflecting her blade with his gauntlet. The clash of metal on metal lasts but a brief moment.\nReckless as always, Wagtail. It'll cost you one of these days.\nHah. Recklessness is a privilege afforded to beautiful women, don't you know? If it's not to your liking, darling, come teach me a lesson.\nLike a moonlit breeze, she takes two steps back and blows him a playful kiss. Then, she leaps into the darkness beneath the tower, leaving naught behind but the ghost of her expensive perfume in the cold night air.\n(The middle section of the volume has been ripped out, perhaps for a purpose other than reading...)\nChapter XVII\nJust as the governor is fuming over the theft of the Sampo Mill, a group of detectives from Snezhnaya suddenly swarm in and clap him in irons! Just what is...?\nHa! Your Excellency, your fury must have overtaken you, such that you've forgotten who Reed Miller is. He is a despicable thief, yes, but is he not also a master of disguise, able to become any man, woman, or child with uncanny skill?\nY—You... That's impossible! This is absurd... If you were pretending to be Leonov, the Oprichniki would surely have—\nThe man posing as Detective Leonov laughs, slowly circling the bound governor twice in a clear mockery of his pompous \"deductions.\"\nThe Oprichniki? You mean the men who tied you up and sealed off this palace? Those are my people. I had them pose as Oprichniki, and your men believed it without question. Surprised, Governor? Have you forgotten how blindly Snezhnayan soldiers follow orders, whether from real superiors or clever impostors? As we speak, the Frostmoon Scions' treasure has been safely returned to their holy lady. Unless you plan to defy the Tsar's will and risk open war with the Frostmoon Scions, recovering the Sampo Mill is no longer an option for you.\nYou... You blasted crook! You accursed thief! I could have tolerated you stealing the Mill, but must you plunder my personal collection too!?\nDoes it matter? Those treasures you claim as yours, those lands you call your own, weren't they stolen from the destitute who live here? The man's demeanor remains perfectly composed, a stark contrast to the agitation written all over the governor's crimson face. \"I see no difference between a bandit who robs the people and a governor who oppresses them. We defend our freedom in the only way we can, because no one else will fight for it. But rest assured, I'm not keeping any of this. Every treasure will be returned to its rightful owner. I shall not keep even a single piece.\"\nAcross the room, Wagtail, posing as a detective, lets out a soft sigh inaudible to the governor.\nOh dear, this man truly is beyond help. He speaks of laying no claim to treasure, when he holds the Frost Moon's most prized gem in his hand...\nWagtail's words stun Shadow Weasel, momentarily pulling her attention away from her adoptive father, who is bound up in the center of the room.\nWh—When? Mr. Reed Miller should've given the Sampo Mill to that holy woman. Wait. He didn't secretly swap it for a fake while we weren't looking, did he...?\nAh, you don't get it, do you? That's exactly how he deceived you young ladies. The woman sighs dramatically. \"What he has stolen for himself is the heart of the Frost Moon's daughter.\""
