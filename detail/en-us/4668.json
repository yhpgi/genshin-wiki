As the Traveler and Paimon searched for the final key in Loch Urania, they encountered a Bathysmal Vishap near an activated altar. They took it for danger and warned Pahsiv, but she only petted the Vishap, and he immediately calmed down. When the Vishap spat out the last key, Pahsiv explained that the filth had wounded the Vishap, but it continued to protect the key."

When the Traveler placed the keys in the statues, a passage opened under the fountain leading to the roots of Erinnyes. To cleanse the roots of the weeping willow from filth, Pahsiv gave the Traveler part of her power, enhancing their abilities. As they fought with the filth, suddenly a magic circle lit up on the ground, from which the Rifthounds appeared. Pahsiv, who had been nearby all the time, suddenly disappeared, and in her place, a Vishap appeared and helped defeat the hounds. When the roots were cleared, the tree recovered and returned to its former appearance.\nAfter saving Erinnyes, Pahsiv found treasure chests for Paimon and the Traveler as a token of gratitude, and in return, they promised to visit her, feed her with tidalga, teach her the language, and teach her how to say goodbye properly.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
