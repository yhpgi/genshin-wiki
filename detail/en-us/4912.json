Then, the skies opened up and invaders from the outside world (presumably, Second Throne) descended, bringing with them a great war, destruction, spreading plagues, and forbidden knowledge. Forbidden knowledge was a form of \"truth\" that could not be comprehended and did not belong to this world. It came from the very bottom of the Abyss, and the world constantly rejected it. After the war, the angels were exiled from Celestia, many of the Lord of Flowers' kind were stripped of their minds, and the goddess's body was wounded. The husks left behind by the beautiful angels became known as the Seelies, and now guide travelers following them to treasures, helping people, just as they did before. For seventy-two nights, Nabu Malikata wandered the barren wastes. Her heels were worn through by the merciless gravel, and her wounds gushed into limpid springs, turning into streams with no boundaries. These streams flowed into verdant gardens, from which sprouted night-blue water lilies â€” the mothers of the Jinn, who were born from intoxicating dreams and bitter memories of loss. The wise Jinn became the familiars of the Lord of Flowers and asked her to stay in the blooming garden. Captivated by their tenderness, the exiled goddess stayed, and where she stepped, flowers of an amazing purple color grew, which were called Padisarahs.\nIn the desert, the Lord of Flowers met the King of the Red Sands,\nThey allied and began to rule the people together. People used to say that the Lord of Flowers was the Lord of Joy and Happiness. Freshwater sprang from her sleeves and thus was the oasis of blossoming flowers born in the desert. Flowers and grasses followed in her footsteps, and gleaming moonlight cleared the way for her. In times of trouble, when the heavens turned away from humanity, the Lord of Flowers extended her mercy to each and every one of the mortals, letting them regain their happiness and egos, allowing leisure and luxury to resume. She bestowed dreams upon the exiled, the manic, and the foolish. In those dreams, they were presented with their dearest delights. Burdened by the cruelty of reality, they were fascinated by the charm of the Lord of Flowers and captivated by her beauty and care. Once, together with the Lord of the Desert, Nabu Malikata built the \"City of Amphitheaters,\" Ay-Khanoum, for the Jinn. In the ancient language of the Jinn, it means \"City of the Moon Maiden.\" But even in that golden time, the Lord of Flowers continued to feel sorrow."

Some gods got drunk: one started playing music and the Greater Lord started singing, so the Goddess of Flowers began to dance. As she danced upon the grass, countless beautiful Padisarahs started to bloom wherever she stepped. Those brilliant purple flowers became her dazzling stage. All the gods clamored, <color=#ffffffd9>\"Oh, if only time could stop at this very moment.\"</color> Dancing in honor of these gods became one of the main traditions of the festival. Even if these deities no longer exist, the tradition of dancing in their honor has remained. The dancer of the Zubayr Theater, Nilou, from the Grand Bazaar, specially designed her costume for the dance to depict the Lord of Flowers. Legends say that the goddess of flowers had beautiful horns on her head, so Nilou made a special crown to show this. Padisarahs, the symbol of the goddess, are placed around the stage during the festival.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "One day, the Mistress of Pushpavatika revealed to her friend, the Lord of the Desert, the truth about the creation of the world. First, the sun and three bright moons were created, and thus day and night came to be. Next, weight was created, and the sand settled, forming the earth. What was weightless became the sky. Then the seven sage monks were established, and they ruled the trajectories drawn by the earth, water, and stars. Even if the celestial sphere was just an illusion, myths are born when people look at the stars and moons. In those peaceful times, divine envoys spoke openly to people, bringing them messages from the heavens. But then the barriers in the original world were torn down, and a dark poison had penetrated the earth. Invaders descended from the clouds, and there was no end to the destruction. These invaders brought war to the angels, and to the whole earth in the vain hope of breaking the bonds. The Master of the heavens, consumed by fear for the rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs, in order to heal this fragile, sad, and imperfect world, brought down the Divine Nails to the earth and destroyed the mortal realms. The angels suffered the torment of exile and lost their connection with the heavens and their capacity for enlightenment. From then on, the Lord of Flowers could not turn her gaze back to the sky, but her home called to her nigh-constantly.\nKing Deshret pondered the words of the Goddess of the Flowers and told her his deepest desires. The cycle of seven must be removed and the sun and moons must be destroyed so that the boundaries between life and death would disappear. The Mistress of Pushpavatika saw an opportunity to transcend the absurd orders that governed this world in Al-Ahmar's words and desires. She warned him against seeking the Master of the Four Shadows and told him of visions of a disastrous future, but the king refused to retreat. The Lord of Flowers had foreseen and planned everything in advance and therefore understood the deep meaning of his words."

Wanderers said this was a place of ever-flourishing greenery, ruled by the slumbering Goddess of Flowers, and the last mother of the Jinn, Ferigees, guarded it. She became the seal on the gates to the oasis, blessing every mortal that came before her with unwavering tenderness, be they good or ill. The Tanit tribe worshiped Nabu Malikata, and the matriarchs considered themselves her daughters. The Eternal Oasis was their religious center. It was believed that whoever took possession of it would receive the throne of Nabu Malikata. They were united by a common dream of the fabled Padisarah garden with unlimited knowledge. Just as the prophecy left by their goddess foretold, even after the scouring of civilization, humanity yet survives by their tenacity. Even deprived of divine guidance, the tribes of the desert found a way to unite via the memories of a goddess long dead. Somewhere in a faraway desert, the imaginings of a time-petrified oasis remain in the minds of a tribe. Yet, these rootless wandering people continue the cycle of life and death amidst the flowing sands of the dunes.\nThe Traveler, along with the mother of the Jinn, Liloupar, and Jeht of Tanit, on behalf of the tribe, disturbed the peace of the oasis by breaking the device that long maintained equilibrium there. The mother of the Jinn hoped to meet her mistress there, but saw that King Deshret had deceived the Jinn and the Lord of Flowers had died long ago. Through Liloupar's entranced eyes, the Traveler saw the oasis of the past: a palace shaped by bricks of crimson jade bound to a garden, flourishing with a multiplicity of vibrant plants that bask in infinite bird-song. The Jinn were minstrels and cupbearers. In her garden, addled monks and ragged wanderers danced, spiraling in step with the daffodils, drinking the lifeblood of the daughters of the vine. There was a garden unlike any other, the place where the Lord of Flowers once lived, the place where she was now sleeping. <color=#ffffffd9>\"The roses blossom like crackling flames, setting the lives of nocturnal birds aflame. And though the candles smile gently, they offer the approaching moths only ruin.\"</color> In this echo of the past, the Traveler saw Nabu Malikata: her skin gleamed with the lunar sheen, and her mien was ineffably beautiful. Her appearance was like the totality of her Jinn, their wondrous aspects only mere petals to her complete flower, her being the quintessence to every last scent in existence. Meeting her gaze, the Traveler saw only nothingness and an endless void. Falling into its embrace, their mind was filled with constant terror.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
