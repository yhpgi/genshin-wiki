        "text": "About 500 years ago, Mary-Ann was a pupil of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, an orphanage in Fontaine. The gentle Oceanid Lyris was the Director of the Institute, and the former Admiral of the White Armada Basil Elton was the Vice Director.\nWhen 500 years ago, Fontaine encountered Cataclysm and Elynas, a being from the Abyss, Basil led the Fontainians to protect the nation and left Mary-Ann and Alain to be raised by her old friend Emanuel Guillotin, a former member of the Marechaussee Hunters. Guillotin did not like children, but for the sake of his old friend, he accepted them, even though he never became their real father.\nAt the Institute, Mary-Ann met other children: Jakob Baker (later Ingold) and Rene de Petrichor, with whom they became friends for many years. Alain later became a researcher at the Institute of Natural Philosophy and made a breakthrough in studying the powers of Pneuma and Ousia, and together with Mary-Ann, they became Marechaussee Hunters. To protect his sister in the service, Alain created the first prototype of a thinking machine — Seymour.\nRene and Jakob founded a secret organization later declared radical, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, while Rene attempted to create Neohumans and avoid the Apocalypse predicted by his world-formula. In their research, they experimented with Scarlet Quartz from the Dragonspine, Dark Mud from the Chasm, Khvarena and Amrita from Sumeru, and the flesh and blood of Elynas. Jakob Ingold gained powers sustained by absorbing Elynas's flesh and became the first Neohuman. The Institute of Natural Philosophy assistant, Carter, changed his form when Rene tried to save him from an incurable disease through experimentation.\nWhen the Marechaussee Hunters learned how far the Narzissenkreuz Ordo research to revive Elynas had gone, they, along with Mary-Ann and Seymour, were sent to stop and arrest the members of the order. A battle occurred between Marechaussee Phantom's agents and the Narzissenkreuz Ordo's members (Jakob, Lyris, and Caterpillar). During the battle, Mary-Ann Guillotin was seriously injured, and Lyris absorbed her consciousness by hugging her. A new Oceanid, Mary-Ann, was born from this merge. Mary-Ann was no longer either Lyris or Mary-Ann Guillotin but embodied their shared consciousness and desires and was something beyond human or Oceanid capable of creating other Oceanids.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

One day, she created another Oceanid, Ann, after seeing her in a dream. Since Ann was part of Mary-Ann, she received a fragment of the memories of Lyris and Mary-Ann Guillotin. Her main memory was the fairytale about the dragon Narcissus. This fairytale was told by Basil Elton to the children in the orphanage where Mary-Ann Guillotin grew up. Ann believed her goal was to save Princess Lyris from the fairytale, who she thought was Mary-Ann herself.\nWhen Ann, with the help of the Traveler and Paimon, went to Annapausis (the former building of the Narzissenkreuz Institute) to rescue the princess, it turned out that Mary-Ann did not want to be rescued and return to reality. She told Ann to live her life and to do what she wanted and then banned them from the Annapausis, destroying the portal through which they got there.\nAnn decided to find out the truth about her origin and teamed up with the mechanical dog Seymour, who wanted to find her owner Mary-Ann, the Traveler, Paimon, and Caterpillar, a member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. Together, they discovered the truth about who Mary-Ann was and decided to use the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz, found while traveling through Annapausis, to separate Mary-Ann Guillotin and Lyris.\nWhen they arrived in Annapausis, they heard Mary-Ann's wishes. She was thinking about the children from the orphanage and her desire to remain alone in her fairytale."

        "text": "A long, long time ago, in a place far, far away, there was once a beautiful and kind Princess named Lyris... and yup, she's our main character!\n\"I don't want this name. It's not what you said before.\"\nOh, come on, it's just a story, there's no need to be so fussy. And so the story goes...\nAnyway, a protagonist needs an antagonist... an evil one, at that!\nAnd our evil antagonist... Well, that's the dragon Narcissus. So evil is he that the peace-loving people tremble at the sound of his name— not that he cares about their feelings, though.\nHe sowed destruction across the land with the searing flames he spewed from his mouth. His great wings turned cities to dust and his burning breath reduced nations to ash.\nAt last, only the Princess's realm remained safe. But because the Princess worked tirelessly to defend her realm, Narcissus's plot to destroy everything could not succeed.\n\"So, in Narcissus's story, I'm the evil villain?\"\nOh? That could be the case, were he the one telling the tale. Something like \"and my plans would have succeeded, if not for that blasted Princess Lyris\"... or something like that.\nAh, no. I told you that it's just a story, right? Princess Lyris is just a character, she's made up. You're you, and you're real. Don't get mixed up, okay?\n\"I don't get it...\"\nOh, be patient. Stop cutting me off! Just let me finish the story first, alright? Now, where were we?\nOh, I almost forgot. Our protagonist needs assistants. Princess Lyris, kind and beautiful as she is, must surely have a ton of friends who are willing to lend a helping hand.\nLet me see... Princess Lyris has a whole bunch of brave and loyal friends, like Al and Ney...\n\"That can't be.\"\nCome on! It's just a story. Anything is possible! In our version, Al and Ney are both friends with Lyris.\nAh, yes, what was Lyris's other friend's name again? The little guy with flaxen hair.\n\"He's not my friend.\"\nBut Princess Lyris can be friends with him, right? I wanna be friends with him too. So, let's let him come along, shall we? What's his name, again?\n\"Alright. Let's call him Kate.\"\nAh! Then Colonel Kate it is. I mean, he's always got that cool and aloof feel to him. Plus, he's always buried in books, so a rank like that really suits him.\nWell, there we have it — we've assembled all the characters for the story! The fearsome dragon, Narcissus, sought to destroy every kingdom upon the land, while Princess Lyris's realm stood strong and unassailable under the protection of her and her trusty friends!\n\"Yeah, I get it. And just as in those stories, the princess and her friends lived happily ever after, forever and ever.\"\nThat's how stories end!\nWe've only just begun. We haven't even reached the exciting parts yet.\n\"Exciting parts?\"\nOf course. After all, why would Narcissus want to destroy everything? And how would Lyris protect everybody? Aren't you the least bit curious about that?\n\"Knowing the ending is good enough, isn't it?\"\nWell, that wouldn't be much fun, would it? The endings may seem alike, but the twists and turns in each story set them apart.\nJust like our story, the lonely Narcissus coveted Lyris's treasure and envied her beauty and kindness, for they were what the dragon once possessed but later lost.\nAs for the treasure that Lyris possesses... let's just say that it's \"time.\"\n\"'Time'?\"\nThat's right! Al once told me, as I recall, that clocks are proof that \"people want to hold time in their hands,\" and Ney said that time always seems to be running out. And Lyris has been lonely for a very long time, hasn't she? If she has friends, if she could share her \"time\" with them, then she would be happy! So let's say Narcissus failed to invade Lyris's realm, for she had shared all this time with her friends. So when they fought him, they had more time on their side — that's why the dragon was no match for Lyris's friends!\nThink about it, Lyris — if we had more time, wouldn't we be able to do more things? For example, Al could strike Narcissus three or four more times — he'd be way stronger with more time! Yup, so that's how we're doing this!\nFollowing that, Lyris's friends made use of the time she had shared with them to thwart Narcissus again and again.\nHowever, the cunning dragon discovered their secret. Like a patient viper, he kept sending his armies to attack, depleting Lyris's time.\nThus did Princess Lyris sacrifice much to protect the kingdom and help her friends win their battles. Over time, she forgot about her friends, because she had given away her past. She no longer laughed and played with her friends, as she had given away her time in the present...\nOne day, finally, the once cheerful spring water fell silent and gloom filled the skies with Narcissus's coming, his wings spread wide. Despite the valiant efforts of Lyris's friends in battle, the dragon was unstoppable, for she had no more time to share with them. The dragon soon arrived before the palace.\nIn the final moments, Lyris gathered her friends, whose names she had no longer remembered, around her and entrusted them with the most precious thing in the world. It was a pure drop of water — yes, as pure as you are.\nShe said, \"This is my future. Take it with you.\"\nShe said: \"Even if I and the kingdom become subject to Narcissus, it shall not matter, for my 'future' shall lie with you.\"\nThen, she made them a promise. \"Even if we have lost our shared 'past' and 'present,' as long as we hold on to the future, the time will come again when we shall reunite, and the kingdom will shine again once more.\"\nAt that moment, the dragon's army blew down the castle gates open with cannon-fire. Lyris urged her friends to flee, which they did only with great difficulty and tearstained faces. Now having lost her future, Princess Lyris, along with the tower she lived in, fell into a stagnant slumber devoid of dreams.\nSo fell the last remaining kingdom of light. Lyris's friends hid in the darkness and endured hardships for a long time. Yet they remained united, bound together by the future the princess had promised them. Well, how do you find the story now?\n\"I don't understand. The past, the present, and the future... I don't get them either. We have no future after such a disaster.\"\nYou see, Al is working hard to assist Lord Neville and secure our future. And aren't you, Ney, and Jak all striving together to create one? Together — that's how we've created much of our \"past,\" right? Now, we are united in the \"present,\" we can surely be together in the \"future,\" too. We'll share the burden of many sorrows and create many joyful moments, too.\n\"Yup, I know...\"\n\"...What about the story, then? What happened to the princess?\"\nHmm... We'll have to save that for another story. Ah, I'm running short on time. Need to head back with that silly dog of mine. I'll share the rest with you next time!\nOh, come on, don't be like that... Alright, how about I come up with the beginning, and you tell me the rest next time? Ahem. Let me think...\n\"A long, long time in the future, in a place far, far away...\"\nThere was a dark empire ruled by the fell dragon Narcissus.\nThe princess he once yearned for had, together with the high tower in which she lived, plunged into a stagnant slumber devoid of dreams, thus remaining untouched by the evil dragon. This enraged Narcissus, so he sent out countless minions to scour the empire for her treasure. He also set up many defensive mechanisms using his baleful sorceries to prevent those on the side of justice from resisting him. He swore that he would reclaim the princess' treasure and awaken her, for only then could he claim her wholly for his own.\nThere was a group of heroes who protected the treasure that the princess had entrusted to them - a clear, bright pearl of water.\nOne day, a tiny life was born from this pearl of water.\nHmm... and what shall we call this life? Ah, what a pain. If I had known that this was how the story might go, I would've used your name here. Any ideas?\n…\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
