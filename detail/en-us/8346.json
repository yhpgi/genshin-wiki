But even so, it remains simply a toy duck that can punch its opponents very, very hard. A creator's preferences will always do much to determine a creation's appearance, as clay lacks the authority to question its creator's choice of molds. The world beneath the moon has long been sculpted into a form that people take for granted, but in the eyes of its original inhabitants, that form must surely be like a peculiar duck, shaped by its creator's bizarre predilections.<br>Of course, the blue-haired maid would never say any such thing to the mistress of the Krumkake Craftshop — after all, ducks are adorable, especially compared to the world's present aspect.",
