Machimos, the outer city of Remuria's capital, was separated from Capitolium by a barrier known as the Initium Iani, which the Vishap-Prince needed to pass through to enter the inner city. The Symphony woven by the God King Remus and his musicians, which encompassed all of Remuria, passed through the barrier. The Harmost and his legions exploited this and shut the gates, thus stopping Scylla and his army. With the three chains in place, he was left immobilized and he could not make it to Domus Aurea in time to complete Remus's final order. His flesh and blood turned to stone, the waves devoured the whole city, and his kindred could not escape. Although Scylla's original body was destroyed, his memories in the Ichor continued to live, but he still remained sealed within the ruins of Machimos.</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>The remnants of the golem army continued to fight the descendants of the dragons.
