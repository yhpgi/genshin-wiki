In the old days, Sea Gazer was close with Mountain Shaper. He was an old good friend of Cloud Retainer and Guizhong and their rival. The open-minded Adeptus passed away a long time ago. The third Lantern Rite, which Traveler and Paimon attended, was dedicated to him.\nSea Gazer adored collecting treasures; he kept them in the abode near the Lisha area. Occasionally he brought them to the Adepti assemblies. According to Cloud Retainer, usually he was calm, but when it came to demonstrating his treasures, he quite often started bragging. As soon as he showed his treasure, it immediately became the center of everyone’s attention, which outraged Cloud Retainer. Often Sea Gazer quarreled with her, because Adeptus’s treasures weren’t the results of his work but were found during his exploration,n where he dug them out of the ground, while Cloud Retainer’s innovations and mechanisms were made by herself.\nSea Gazer used to be the owner of the Fantastic Compass — an artifact that symbolized the unity of an Adeptus and a mortal, and the legendary Sunset Vermillionite; the Fantastic Compass was made to protect the people. Sea Gazer gifted the artifact to the mortal as a token of friendship, and lately it was used during the Cataclysm when the Milleliths were fighting against the Abyssal creatures in the Chasm. Vermillionite allowed any creation to soar in the sky. This material was used for the Jade Chamber construction and its reconstruction after the battle with Osial, Overlord of the Vortex, when he tried to attack the harbor. Same kind of stone is used for the Mingxiao Lantern — the biggest lantern built during Lantern Rite, which is constructed using the funds and donations from the annual Xiao Market.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
