  "desc": "A flower in two entwined colors with a strong affinity for kuuvahki. Its light fragrance and conspicuous color have made it an excellent natural dye.<br>Its contrasting colors are thought to symbolize the two different types of kuuvahki, so the followers of the Frostmoon Scions sometimes regard it as the Moon Maiden's blessing.<br>It is said that this strangely shaped flower first appeared decades after the dark calamity ended five hundred years ago, a claim widely reflected in the verses of the Frostmoon Scions, though it has never been rigorously verified.",
