        "text": "500 years ago, during the Cataclysm, Rene, Jakob, and Jakob's adoptive father, Karl Ingold, embarked on an expedition to Vourukasha Oasis, Sumeru. Rene became fascinated by Khvarena and the Sacred Lotus, Gaokerena, created by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, from the consciousness of the former Hydro Archon Egeria. He observed that it shared a similar composition to the tissues in the organisms of Jakob and Rene himself but different from the tissues of Karl. Despite Rene's attempts to obtain more data samples to verify this finding, Shamaniyya refused his requests. In addition, he discovered some Khaenri'ahn records, with the help of which he later created the world-formula.\nDuring his research, Rene unearthed countless books left by an ancient order and Khaenri'ahn records, which aided him in deciphering ancient texts. Using his world-formula, similar to Remurian \"Fortuna\", he deduced the imminence of another flood in Fontaine. After countless calculations, Rene received the same result: the apocalypse cannot be avoided. Furthermore, he discovered a method to extract \"will,\" which he believed could offer protection from the flood's effects. Upon arriving in Fontaine, he sought to discuss the possibility of saving the nation with his child prodigy friend, Alain Guillotin.\nDuring the expedition, Jakob, a child at the time, fell seriously ill and lapsed into a coma. Desperate to save him, Rene resorted to using powers akin to those of the Abyss. Jakob's body responded favorably to these powers, facilitating his recovery. Emboldened by this success, Rene incorporated the results into his ongoing research. Karl Ingold, however, harbored suspicions regarding Jakob's sudden recovery. To dispel these suspicions, Rene fabricated and altered diaries.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Although Rene and Alain had quite different interests and approaches to research, together they studied the powers of controlled annihilation of the Pneuma and Ousia that were contained in the body of every organism in Fontaine. Subsequently, Alain's studies led to Fontaine's energy revolution, making him one of the greatest scientists.\nWhile working at the Institute of Natural Philosophy, Rene was struck by the conservatism of scientists towards new ideas, expecting an open mind from them. Despite his attitude, he tried to gain the favor of scientists for the sake of their opportunities and influence. Some of these scholars later became members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, almost worshiping Rene and Jakob. Rene was disappointed that the representatives of the Institute of Natural Philosophy could turn into believers, but he used their resources for his own purposes, which included the construction of the Tower of\nHaving learned about the illness of Alain's assistant, Carter, Rene decided to stop research in the laboratory and make every effort to cure Carter. He sent tissue samples to Sumeru, where medicine was advanced, in hopes of getting answers, but no one could offer a solution. Then Jakob put forward the idea of treating Carter with the help of the Abyssal powers, which was used to save Jakob during the desert expedition. After considering Jakob's proposal and discussing all possible risks with Carter, Rene began treatment. The Abyssal powers (Elynas's flesh) began to destroy Carter's tissues, and although Rene managed to temporarily stabilize his condition and stop the destruction, the treatment was unsuccessful.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

This phenomenon turned out to be similar to Rene's computational scheme, called the \"world-formula.\" After countless calculations, he found a discrepancy with Fortuna: unlike the world depicted in these ancient texts, there will be no more new civilizations born.

Following moral decay, the will became shackled to bodily form, willpower withered, and humanity became entirely enslaved to their flesh. The Remurians reached heights that were challenging to attain in study and differentiation of the spirit. According to the Harmost Aurelius, all phenomena were divided into four categories: Substance, Property, Quality, and Relation. Quality was the keystone, which is what is often called the \"Quadrant of Qualities\": memories, wishes, soul, and persona. Spirit was also divided into these four components. Among these, the state that came closest to the perfect freedom that divinities possessed was named \"True Will.\" Ancient Remurians saw it as the detachment of human will with such meticulous research. Upon learning of this, Rene decided that separating a person's will could be the key to salvation from the prophecy. The God King Remus created imperishable bodies of stone and bronze for the Remurians. The Remurians wanted to create an object endowed with meaning, the essence of which would be determined only by Quality. One of these items was a sword forged in memory of the Harmost Euergetia. Rene wanted to create Neohumans and separate the will of the Fontainians to wait out the apocalypse and escape fate. At the Narzissenkreuz Institute, Rene discovered the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz, capable of uniting and concentrating the will of many people. In the Narzissenkreuz Ordo's brand of mystical philosophy, the Holy Blade was \"reason,\" that which cuts everything open. It could only be born out of consummate human will. The Ordo used this sword to sever the people's will. Just like the Remurians separated their melody in order to escape the prisons of rotting flesh and gain eternal and independent life, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo wanted to get rid of the shackles of the physical body through the separation of the will."
