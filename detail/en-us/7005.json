Ace Angler Paimon, you're up!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to your Saurian companion</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThis shallow water beach looks great! It's warm, bright, and there are fishing rods set up here. Maybe this would make a good fishing spot!\nWhy don't we try fishing here?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nMaybe I'll catch myself another travel guide...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo way, Paimon vetoes that idea. Besides, there's only one Paimon, and you already caught her!\nPaimon's talking about fish-fishing! It's been a while since we last ate fish you caught and cooked yourself... Plus, it's about time you gave Little One a taste of your culinary wizardry!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, it's all for poor old Little One, y'know...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nThen why don't you get involved too, Paimon...\nHow about... you do the fishing this time, Paimon?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh? You want P—Paimon... to do the fishing?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nAll for poor old Little One, eh?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHow... How could you, catching Paimon out with her own words like that!\nUgh, alright then... But be warned, Paimon has no idea what she'll catch, if anything!\nPlus, before that... Ace Angler Paimon needs a nice, tidy environment to work her magic in. What if the line gets snagged on all that junk floating around in the water?\nLet's tidy up the area a bit first!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Clean up the nearby waters</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nPhew, nice and tidy at last... G—Guess it's time for Paimon to get started with the fishing!\nJust you wait and see, Paimon's gonna catch a big one!\n<color=#ffffff>Sadly, the surface stays as still as a mirror, without a ripple in sight.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUhh... Is there something wrong with the water here? The fish don't seem to want to come out, at all!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>So close, hehe...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo close! Yet... so far. Ugh, why does it feel like this is gonna take forever...\nIt's a bit early to be getting Paimon's hopes up!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It won't be long, trust me! Just stay cool!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm, you're probably right. After all, once the bites start coming, it all happens so fast. Like when you go to pick a Sweet Flower, but it turns out to be a Whopperflower...\nAll you gotta do is stay focused and wait... and wait...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nYou've got it! You've got it!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, stop being such a distraction... Jeez!\nEhh!? We've got a bite, we've got a bite! Time to reel it in and see what Paimon's caught!\nWhat the... that's not a fish, it's a bottle! And it's even tied to one of the wooden planks at the fishing spot... Ugh, well, the fact that you always catch strange things too makes Paimon feel a little better, Traveler...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nYou seem to be able to catch anything... but fish.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, you catch weird stuff all the time too! Anyway, seeing as Paimon already caught it, we might as well take a look at what's inside...\nOpens the note in the drift bottle\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nCould it have been these two that left behind that pile of stuff just now? People who are this obsessed with fishing are... pretty scary, huh...\nSeems like they're using this bottle to pass messages to one another... We'd better throw it back.\nAaaanyway, Paimon has a funny feeling that it'll definitely be a fish next time!\n<color=#ffffff>The rod suddenly drops downwards and starts being violently tugged.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Seems like something big and heavy deep down below has taken the bait...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nA bite, at last! Must be one heckuva fish... Up you come, you big lump!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nThat's right, you big lump! Up you come!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nR—Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Seeing Paimon struggling,</color>\n<color=#ffffff>you and Little One grab hold of her...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>But the line is being pulled with such unstoppable force...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Finally, with a mighty plop, the fish escapes...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\n*sobs* That must have been a huge one, otherwise it would never have gotten away!\nUgh, so annoying... Huh? It's still swimming around near the surface! Seriously!?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawrr—\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo no no, the sea's too dangerous! And you'll never catch up with it anyway...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIf only we could find a way to catch that fish, Traveler...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Wait for Paimon to fish</color>\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Little One\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYikes, that's one strong fish. How's it still able to swim so fast, even after such a long struggle...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawrrr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo worries, Traveler'll definitely be able to catch it again!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Catch the fleeing fish</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Bring the fish back to shore</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTada! What did Paimon tell ya? If anyone could get the better of this slippery customer, it'd be Traveler!\nSpeaking of skills, if we just threw in all the bait and let the fish get so full that they turned over and floated up to the surface... that would still count as \"fishing,\" right?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRrrar... Rawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, you think so too, don't you, Little One? Paimon can tell just from the way your eyes are twinkling! Hehe, let's give it a try next time...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawrrr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWait a sec, it's not done yet! We have to wait for Traveler to finish cooking it first!\n<color=#ffffff>Once the fish is finished grilling, everyone sits down and eats their fill.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWah... Even as Grilled Fish goes, that was something special. You can really tell that Paimon was the one who caught it, hehe!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nGreat job, Paimon! You're in charge of fishing from here on out!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUhhh... *sigh*\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, there's no such thing as a free lunch, y'know, Little One! You'll have to help out too next time — if you want any fish, that is!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRrrawr?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmph, look who's playing dumb now!"
