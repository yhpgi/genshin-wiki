However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.\nHowever, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character — it was none other than \"Regrator,\" Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.\nYelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.\nNow, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.\nIn fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.\nRegrator had intended it as an offer to the Tsaritsa, yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.\nNot only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa — she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.\nThis series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant — depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.\nThe cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.\nNone of that really bothers her though. Instead, she takes immense pleasure from it."

It gives you a much clearer view, in any case.\nEveryone has self-interest, but you cannot let it be your master. So don't fight over fleeting gains and losses. Rather, focus on the direction your heart is leading you, and keep moving forward.\n<color=#ffd780>About the Fatui</color>\nZhiyi colluded with the Fatui to try and secure the position of Tianshu. Or, to put it the other way around, the Fatui made an attempt to interfere in the Tianshu selection process.\nWith Yusupov in our hands and a statement from Zhiyi, we could afford to continue with a diplomatic offensive.\nAlso, we'd be able to gain control of Theofan, Yusupov's second-in-command. Then we'd have a pawn in the ranks of the Fatui.\nPawns like this can be major assets. They open up all sorts of new options.\nThe first part went off without a hitch, and we passed all the information on to Lady Ningguang.\nBut when we tried to make contact with Theofan, he was gone... along with all the evidence.\nThe Fatui must be spying on us. Otherwise, they'd never have been able to respond so quickly.\nI found out from other sources that the Harbinger \"Regrator\" got involved.\nThe Fatui's main forces aren't concentrated here. Regrator was only treating this as a peripheral concern.\n<color=#ffd780>About Regrator</color>\n\"Regrator\" is the 9th of the Fatui Harbingers, though likely the first among them where wealth is concerned.\nHowever, his \"wealth\" is not a mere question of how much Mora he has to his name. He has a very unique understanding of wealth... And what he's planning may very well shake the world to its core."
