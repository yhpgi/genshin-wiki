When compared to the traditional configuration created by Alain Guillotin, their calculations show that, in an ideal situation, the configuration's optimal output is slightly higher than the traditional one. The paper they created together elaborates on the operating principle and design requirements of the configuration and was selected as Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering's Outstanding Paper of the Year. As a result, Monsieur Bossuet was awarded the title of Senior Technician. After Mr. Bossuet left his post, everyone was scattered throughout the institute. According to Mr. Bossuet's original plan, Coppelius and Coppelia are clockwork meka dedicated to the art of dance. After Maillardet took over the project, Pneumousia was added, making them not only good at dancing but also highly capable fighters. Two different combat modes for Coppelius and Coppelia were created based on the differences between Pneuma and Ousia, Nemesis of Coppelius and Dirge of Coppelia. Edwin Eastinghouse is a former Senior Technician who conducted experiments using Arkhium to defy gravity with the hopes of lifting the elegant Court of Fontaine into the sky as a means to avoid the prophesied flood.

Consequently, the Experimental Field Generator lost control and now occupies this area of the institute. The explosion claimed the lives of several researchers.

However, he was dismissed from his post as Senior Technician with further investigation pending due to being absent from work for a long period without having submitted any application. Given his unique personality and unconventional research methods, the institute leaders were comfortable with his absence. Arkhium has come to be perceived as an ill omen by some, who attribute evil properties to the stones, foreseeing disaster for the greedy and misfortune for the ignorant. Others still see the potential value in Arkhium and consider there to be hidden potential within that has yet to be fully tapped.\n<color=#ffffff73>The Arkhium Kinetic Core is the fruit of Raimondo's joint research with Edwin Eastinghouse. They believed that if they constantly injected the kinetic core with enough energy, it would easily allow the Experimental Field Generator to run at full power. After creating the core, they both realized they could barely find a way to keep injecting it with enough energy to keep it at maximum power. Edwin and Raimondo tried powering it with a mixture of Pneumousia and Arkhium energy or by connecting large numbers of Arkhium ores in series to create a super-powered group, but neither worked. They came across the giant Arkhium, and although it was always in an inert state, they were certain that this ore had unprecedented purity. They believed that, with the right treatment, the giant Arkhium could output the large amount of energy needed. Edwin and Raimondo had a disagreement due to Raimondo offering a more conservative proposal when Edwin wanted to solve the problem quickly. After the explosion, Raimondo promptly led the disaster investigation and evaluation efforts. The mixture of intelligence and passion at the Research Institute yielded outcomes that exceeded all expectations, regrettably, there is seldom anyone left to acknowledge this remarkable achievement.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

A secondary explosion, minor in comparison to the one caused by Mr. Edwin, occurred at the ruins of the Central Laboratory, which dispersed numerous condensing components of the Arkhium inhibitor into the surrounding waters. This secondary explosion was the result of energy flow affecting a small portion of Arkhium in the ruins. A suppression device was implemented, and the crisis was averted, however, a senior researcher named Mr. Nacker escaped. Mr. Nacker worked with Mr. Eastinghouse, and is believed to have triggered the small explosion in order to steal the Arkhium Kinetic Core to make a \"small fortune.\"\n<color=#ffffff73>Later, a special investigator named Miss Fusilier was hired to take charge of the stolen Arkhium Kinetic Core case. The main objective is to retrieve the Arkhium Kinetic Core as soon as possible, as it is an extremely unstable prototype. The investigation led Fusilier to Chaussivert, a self-proclaimed \"Harbor-Watcher\" of Lumidouce Harbor. Chaussivert disclosed critical information, which led the investigation to a shipment of goods that may reveal Mr. Nacker's whereabouts. A residence emitting clear residual energy readings all around was discovered as the investigation unfolds. Miss. Fusilier broke the house lock when none other than the missing Edwin Eastinghouse was found inside. Edwin surreptitiously pointed out Nacker's current whereabouts to be around the Fort Charybdis Ruins. Nacker revealed he was working on a \"Field Generator\" and was attempting to synchronize it with the Arkhium Kinetic Core in hopes of being the greatest kinetic engineer ever. It came to light that Edwin Eastinghouse led the investigation against Nacker on purpose, and he encouraged Nacker to go back to the institute and repent. Edwin wanted to get back to his research and claimed he wasn't present when the core exploded. After Nacker and Edwin exchanged a few words, Fusilier stated both of them harmed the interests of the institute and as the special investigator of the Fontaine Research Institute, she demanded both be taken to the institute to be dealt with accordingly. Upon arrival at the institute, after enough time has passed for Edwin and Raimondo to exchange words, the Maison Gardiennage's personnel arrived and took both Nacker and Edwin to the Fortress of Meropide.</color>"
