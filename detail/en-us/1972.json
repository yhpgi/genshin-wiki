With it, you shall repel every demon.\"\nSo the doctor took up that devilishly red staff, igniting all that was impure.\nThose who have passed, unable to bear deep sadness, but who have since become shrouded by ill karma and calamity,\nThey shall be reduced to ashen butterflies in this flame, and receive relief from their misfortunes and hurts.\nAs for the doctor who lit those countless flames, legend has it that they, too, were reduced to smoke in the shape of a lovely butterfly.\nThough these rites have been forgotten over time and with the coming of peace,\nThose with fire in their hearts can still hear these whispered words from flickering flames when they find themselves faced with an imposing darkness:\n\"Only an unbound flame can purify this world.\""
