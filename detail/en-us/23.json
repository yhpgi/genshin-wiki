But once he had a few Mora in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time — one of the city's taverns.\nUnfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.\nThe first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: \"I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here...\" Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...\nThe strategy he developed was drinking on the job — that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.\nThe novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.\nThere was just one snag — he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...\nAnd if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.\nVenti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.\nEasier said than done — the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him."

In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the Statues of The Seven that appear across the land — even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos's past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.\nIn contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the Cryo Archon's scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...\nWorshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications. But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse.\n\"How can you know that they're fabrications?\"\nHe has a point — even the most devoted sister could not possibly know the details of all of Barbatos's deeds from a millennium ago.\nOnly Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.\nReason being, yes — Venti's tall tales of Barbatos's unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.\nHey, Venti finds that a few drinks really gets his muse going. Can you really blame him?"

The wind's ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.\nThe Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.\nIn those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.\nHe who would in latter days be known as \"Barbatos\" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.\nIn Mondstadt of old, Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.\n\"I do so wish to see the birds in flight.\"\nSo said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.\n\"Friend, will you not come along?\""

The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.\nHis first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.\nFor only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.\nPlucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.\nHe bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.\nIn future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.\n\"Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place.\"\nThus, a new age began for Mondstadt."

He heard the cry of the slave girl Vennessa, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.\n—Now, the above is what all know to be the official history of Mondstadt.\nThe story has an interesting, little-known twist, however.\nThe one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa — but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a \"treachery against the wind.\"\nA secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city — the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.\nAt the treaty's end was carved an insignia inimitable by all save the deity so named: Rex Lapis.\nHow the soldiers that had once oppressed the slaves shuddered when they saw that they too would become slaves in a foreign land.\nThe news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.\nAs it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but could never deceive the god of wealth and transactions. Even so, his adeptness would come into play after several hundred years.\nWhat a happy coincidence."
