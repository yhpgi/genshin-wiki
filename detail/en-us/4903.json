Although she knew that the real Durin's fate will be connected with Durin of Simulanka, she hoped that one day he will have his own path. Like the real Durin, a dragon of the magical world, destroyed everything he touched, and people feared him. When he wished never to be born at all, a few heroes from Teyvat appeared in Simulanka and saved the dragon. When Andersdotter was creating Durin of Simulanka, her son, another witch, Barbeloth, made a prophecy about Teyvat's Durin: <color=#ffffffd9>\"R's child... will one day rise from the dead.\"</color> <color=#ffffff73>Recent observations at Dragonspine lend credence to this prophecy, and Durin's heart has slowly but surely been growing in vitality. The process is extremely slow, but the trend is clear. Albedo, Durin's brother, hopes that when the time comes, Simulanka's Durin will lend Mondstadt a hand in their hour of need.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
