She wanted to give him many siblings, to meet many friends, and to see the beautiful sights beyond that cosmic dark. Elynas's elder siblings treated him well, and later, Elynas learned to take care of his younger siblings.\nLater, Elynas along with his siblings left the world beneath the earth. He felt the wind brushing against his skin, the warmth of the sun, waters icy and warm. At first, Elynas was happy, but he soon discovered that what seemed interesting and funny to him was scary and dangerous for others. He learned that his blood was poisoned and that he was bringing suffering and destruction to the people of Teyvat, but it was too late."

It was Jakob Ingold and Rene de Petrichor, who used the flesh and blood of Elynas to research and improve the powers of the first Neohuman Jakob. But one day, many other creatures appeared in his body, including metal machines, a spirit of the primordial waters, and other people. There was a battle and an explosion inside Elynas's body that damaged his flesh, and from these wounds, the Melusines, Elynas's children, were born. Each Melusine was born with a shard of broken Meks, so they began considering these objects as their \"token\" that must be protected."

There he described his work at the Institute of Natural Philosophy and experiments on assistant Carter Scherbius, who was suffering from an incurable disease; experiments on Jakob to create the first Neohuman; special Remurian technique \"Seal of Chymical Marriage;\" extracting the will of people to obtain their knowledge and skills; the construction of the Tower of Ipsissimus, with the help of which the Narzissenkreuz Ordo were going to extract the will of all the people in Fontaine; as well as his becoming Narzissenkreuz."

To humans, the \"World Within the Book\" looked like ruins with monsters, but to the Melusines, creatures of the Abyss, it seemed like a beautiful garden. Inside the book, the Traveler, Paimon, and a Melusine, Canotila, met \"Puppy\" and their friend, Caterpillar. Puppy and Caterpillar were both parts of Carter Scherbius’s personality, a friend of Jakob and Rene. To Canotila, Puppy seemed like a cute dog, and the Melusine often came to play with it, until one day it asked her to leave and not come back. Puppy was afraid that \"The World Within the Book\" was beginning to collapse and was dangerous for others."

Although Lutine's dishes are inedible to look at and their stimulating scent makes your eyes swell up, they turn out to be very tasty, and after a single bite, the pungent flavors also become surprisingly amiable. One of Melusine's special dishes is Poissonchant pie, which is made from fish, bacon, flour, and eggs. It looks like a tool to cast some kind of forbidden magic due to the fish heads that stick out from the cake and stare at the eyes, gleaming with a strange light. For Melusines, these heads look like a choir in a picture book, with everyone holding their heads up high and singing happily. Despite its peculiar appearance, the pie tastes great."

The only one who knows how to play it is Topyas, a musical performer. Her \"token\" is a piece of conch harps, so her first memories of the world are related to music. Some ancient Remurian scores were written exclusively for this instrument, and only a few experts in Remurian writing can decipher them. One day, Topyas found one of these scores, \"Melody of Vesta,\" and wanted to play it for her sister Mamere as a farewell. When Mamere heard the melody, she saw tall towers and magnificent ships.\nIn the village, there is a legend about the Crab Demon Emperor, who was defeated by the Ultimate Overlord's Mega Magic Sword. Long ago, in the distant seas dwelt the great Crab Demon Emperor. The hoard of gold in the Crab's treasury was as high as Mont Automnequi, and his clicking crab claws could easily scare those who antagonized the Emperor, but His Majesty complained about the lack of friends. One day, the Crab Demon Emperor met a little Melusine who invited it to play. Although the Crab Emperor in truth was glad to see the Melusine, he refused: <color=#ffffffd9>\"An overlord cannot play with little Melusines, or he shall lose his kingly majesty.\"</color> He said that no emperor gives up their rule, but if some hero defeated the demon lord using their holy blade, then a former overlord could play with the Melusine. The Melusine returned to the Merusea Village and told the story to her sisters. They arrayed her with a great seashell for a shield, crowned her with a seagrass laurel, and canvas from a wrecked ship within Elynas they brought for her cloak. At last, they armed her with a rare piece of dried cardboard — her treasured sword. Thus did the Melusine heroine embark on a journey to defeat the Crab Demon Emperor, and with her peerless magical blade did she cast the marauding tyrant down. From then on, Mr. Crab, no longer a demon lord, would become the Melusines' good friend.\nIn this subarea, the world quests"

Since Jakob Ingold used Elynas's flesh and blood to enhance his powers, he tried to revive the heart again 400 years later, but Elynas feared that this would lead to the destruction of the Merusea Village and the death of his daughters. Thanks to the help of the Traveler and Mamere, the only Melusine capable of hearing Elynas, Jakob was stopped. During Jakob's ritual, Elynas's entire body began to become contaminated with his blood, which was poisonous to others and caused hallucinations in the Traveler. After the battle with Jakob, Elynas asked Mamere to draw a picture with his blood, with which he could contact the Traveler."

Nearby waters are haunted by ghostly legends, but this makes it the perfect place to hide for those who seek secrecy.\nThe Elton Trench was named after the head of the Fontaine fleet and the captain of the ship Sponsian, Basil Elton. In the glorious past, the pure white ironclad flagship \"Sponsian\" was the pride of Fontaine's Navy and the darlings of the Court of Fontaine. One day, they destroyed the golem legion and defeated an abysmal crab that was attacking ships. Many legends and performances in the old opera house were made about the \"White Armada\" and \"Sponsian.\" Of them, the most memorable performance appears to be the final battle of the armada: A heroic battle with a formidable barrage performed by ten battleship cannons onstage, with the details having been reconstructed from the records of Basil Elton's First Mate."

When Fontaine was overrun by monsters from the Abyss 500 years ago, Basil returned to the bridge of the Sponsian and led a fleet to defend Fontaine. For about 35 days they followed the giant beast from the Abyss, Elynas, destroying other monsters. The ships Caledones and Venicones were destroyed, and the Sponsian itself was broken in two in the battle with Elynas. Basil Elton herself died in this battle and never returned to the children from the orphanage. Almost everyone except the Captain, Chief Engineer, and the First Mate, Nathaniel Pickman, abandoned the ship before it was destroyed. At the bottom of the Elton Trench lies the wreckage of ships destroyed in a battle with the Abyssal monsters. One half of the \"Sponsian\" was stuck in the body of Elynas, and another ghostly half of the ship can be seen in the Elton Trench wandering in the waters. If you touch the ship, you can hear echoes of the memories of the ship's crew."
