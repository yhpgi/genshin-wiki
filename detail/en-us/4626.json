But is the victim necessarily entirely innocent?\nBrandt got his just deserts, while Athos will spend the rest of his life in hiding.\nAll those who know the full story, if you are willing to help Athos get the truth out,\n<color=#37ffff>Please look for the thank-you gifts he has left on the beach between the waterfalls</color> . Your kindness should be rewarded."
