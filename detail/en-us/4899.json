There was a war between the Lord of the Tower, Decarabian, and the King of the North Wind, Andrius. It was a time when Mondstadt was a frozen wasteland, and nothing could survive outside the Old Mondstadt. Tired of the attacks of the God Andrius, Decarabian built a wall of storms around his capital, so that the King of the North Wind could not break through. Decarabian believed that he protected his people and that the people worshiped him out of love, but in reality, they lived in tyranny, restrictions, and fear. Each resident of the city was assigned their own role; songs and music were forbidden; and people’s backs did not straighten due to the raging winds."

The tyrant was defeated by Amos's arrow, Amos herself and the Nameless Bard fell in battle, and the spirit absorbed the powers of the deceased Archon and became the new Anemo Archon Barbatos, taking on the appearance of the Nameless Bard.
