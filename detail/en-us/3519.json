But there came a day when they, despite their might, found that their deeds had taken their toll and that the remnants of divine bitterness had begun to poison them. Having fallen under the influence of the hatred of the defeated gods, they became bound by karmic debt. Karmic debt is a kind of poison for Yakshas, their punishment for countless murders; it causes them severe pain, infects their consciousness, and causes anger, pain, and horror. Some descended into a blind rage of a kind that cannot be put into words or were driven by fear to equally indescribable madness. Some turned on and destroyed each other. Some were lost to delusions of the mind."
