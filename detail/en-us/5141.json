The novel centers around two illegitimate children born to a baron's maid, who endured mistreatment in the baron's household. After their mother was killed, they fled home but vowed to avenge her. The brother and sister became experienced musketeers and, years later, began to take revenge on members of the baron's family to uncover the truth about their mother's death and restore justice. During the Fontinalia Film Festival, this novel became the basis of a film produced by Xavier and directed by Furina. The same book became the inspiration for a series of murders investigated by Chevreuse, the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. As in the book, the killer left a rainbow rose at the crime scene, and these roses led Chevreuse, with the help of perfumer Emilie, to the killer. The flowers were from a rare cultivar that grew precisely in the Baptiste's garden in a village on the west slopes of Mont Automneqi. Chevreuse's investigation revealed that Baptiste wrote \"The Two Musketeers\" based on real events from his life: his mother, Elisa, was murdered as a result of an affair with a member of a wealthy family, leaving Baptiste and his sister, Veronica alone. Veronica decided to take revenge on her father. Her first victim was the assassin sent to kill her mother. Although Baptiste, Veronica, and their father were sent to the Fortress of Meropide, Chevreuse asked the Duke of the Fortress, Wriothesley, to tell the prisoners about the siblings' difficult past and the actions of their father."

        "text": "Once, the authorities of Fontaine wanted to create an undercity beneath the city, the Fleuve Cendre, from the sewers under the Court of Fontaine. Since it was difficult to maintain order, Eduardo Baker and his friends seized power in the Fleuve Cendre. They began to resolve disputes between Fleuve Cendre \"compatriots,\" bless the newly wedded, and protect the merchants from being extorted, harassed, and blackmailed by the gangs. When the authorities of the Court of Fontaine decided to purge the Fleuve Cendre, Baker was arrested and exiled to the desert. On the way to exile, he, with the help of his henchmen, fled to Poisson, taking hostage both the city itself and the members of the Maison Gardiennage who were transporting Baker. He made several unreasonable demands, so the Marechaussee Hunters, under the direction of Emanuel Guillotin, intervened. Journalist Karl Ingold arrived in Poisson as a negotiator along with Eduardo's son, Jakob.\nFollowing an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the issue, the disagreement between Baker's group and the Marechaussee Hunters turned into a violent fight. As a result, Jakob and Rene, the Poisson Mayor's son, were left orphans. They were both sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute, an orphanage that often housed the children of criminals. Later, these two children founded The Narzissenkreuz Ordo, one of the most important organizations in Fontaine's History. The Siege of Poisson left physical and mental scars on Guillotin. Due to this event, he left the ranks of the Marechaussee and planned to live out the rest of his days, content with just the contents of his cup.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The organization, which headquarters is located within the ship, was founded by Callas in Poisson. A gigantic and glamorous ship embodies discovery, opportunity, ambition, and conquest. It symbolizes Spina di Rosula's bright and limitless future. The Spina's emblem, featuring an anchor and roses, was designed by Clementine, Callas's wife and Navia's mother, the current head of the organization.\nOne of Callas's most important projects was the construction of aquabus water lines stretching throughout Fontaine. When the construction of the lines was discussed, Spina di Rosula was divided into two parties. Callas believed that the organization had a rare opportunity to establish cooperation with the authorities of the Court of Fontaine and the Research Institute and that the construction of the lines would help to establish useful connections. The aquabuses were supposed to bring commercial benefits and a good reputation among the residents of Fontaine. The second party, led by a Spina di Rosula member Romeuf, thought that such significant sums would be better invested in the development of Poisson. When the parties could not agree, Romeuf and his supporters harbored a grudge against Callas and Clementine, considering her biased because of her pregnancy. For Romeuf's group, Clementine's support for the construction of the lines was a betrayal, meaning their voices would never be heard again. After Clementine died due to complications during the birth of her daughter, Callas began to view the construction of lines as the embodiment of her last will. Then the last hope of compromise disappeared, so Romeuf left Spina di Rosula."

The Callas line leading from the Court of Fontaine to the Research Institute was destroyed when the Institute's Central Laboratory exploded.\nMany years later, when the daughter of Clementine and Callas, Navia, became the president of the organization, Romeuf decided to take revenge on Spina di Rosula and blow up the Clementine line passing over Poisson. His assistant Colter, who had recently left the Fortress of Meropide, blamed all the troubles that happened to Spina di Rosula on Navia, because of whom, in his opinion, Clementine, Callas, and the former butler Melus died. He believed that Navia destroyed everything dear to him with her own hands and brought Poisson to destruction. Navia was able to defeat Colter in a fight, and the Traveler and Paimon defused the bombs and saved the line from destruction.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Residents of Poisson did not immediately recognize the danger, so passers-by who found themselves near the water immediately disappeared. After this, people began to run in panic, hoping to reach higher places. Some people were injured during the stampede or fell from heights. When a rescue operation was organized, many were saved, but Melus and Silver, Navia's assistants who helped with the evacuation, did not manage to leave in time. The head of Spina di Rosula Navia, with the support of the Fatui Harbinger Arlecchino, was able to ensure the safety of the affected residents of Poisson, evacuating them from the town.\nThe people of Poisson blamed Hydro Archon Furina for the disaster, as they believed that she did nothing to save them. After the incident, the town gradually began to recover, and Navia promised compensation to all victims. Although the financial situation of the Spina is far from desired, this promise helped express the attitude towards what had happened so that people would again believe in the organization."
