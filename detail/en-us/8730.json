            "text": "Tassel Jelly\nSaid to be a species unique to Nod-Krai. It has a pink bell and long tentacles. These jellyfish are usually found near the beaches on Maroon Basin, where the shallow tidal zones make perfect hunting grounds for tiny plankton. Even after the tide recedes, they glide effortlessly on land â€” likely thanks to specialized water sacs that keep them moisturized, or perhaps mucus-secreting glands that minimize dehydration. Their tentacles are far tougher than a typical jellyfish's and seem to possess some unique power, though perhaps only effective against their prey. I carefully poked one with a stick, and it did not react much, nor did it attack me. (Prodding a jellyfish, ha! I dare say no one in the Conch Gang has guts like mine!) They \"communicate\" by intertwining their tentacles, like humans shaking hands or high-fiving. Which means... those dance-like movements they make when they gather are probably their own \"unique language.\" Although they don't have brains, it seems they possess some measure of intelligence.\nUnfortunately, it looks like the Fatui's blasted facilities have all but destroyed the habitats of the Tassel Jellies. The machinery they brought in roars away day and night... I don't know what those contraptions even do, but it looks like the entire area's been sapped of life. Maybe because they've lost their source of food, or maybe it's all the awful noise pollution, or maybe it's both. I saw some jellyfish that had collapsed on the beach. I tried helping them, but... I was too late."
