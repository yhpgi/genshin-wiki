Thanks to this friendship, Callirhoe learned to speak again.\nSeveral years later, Callirhoe felt that the boy had feelings unknown to her. She was afraid of the separation, afraid that the boy would regret it at the end of his life, and ran away. She hoped that the boy would forget about her and live his own life, but every day he came to the spring and waited for her, doubting whether it was all real. Many years later he remained alone and could not comprehend the fairy's disappearance."
