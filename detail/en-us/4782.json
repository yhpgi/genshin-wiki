The vile demon struck again with all his might, but Skybracer managed to dodge the attack, so the hit landed on Mt. Tianheng. It was so powerful that the base of the mountain cracked. Suddenly, there was a thunderous sound of giant rocks rolling down the mountains, and the whole of Mt. Tianheng was on the verge of collapse. Skybracer knew he had to act quickly, so he summoned a fellow Adeptus. With a strike of his polearm this Adeptus tore clean the antlers of the Skybracer’s head. Skybracer used his own blood-drenched antlers as a wedge to prop up the mountain. His blood coated his head, but he just grotesquely wiped his hand across his blood-soaked skull, and began racing back up the mountain to wipe the vile demon off the face of the earth. He looked like a king of the demons himself, but to the people who lived below the mountain, Skybracer was their savior, a great and merciful Adeptus who had saved them all from certain doom. These people thought more highly of him than they thought of the Lord of Geo. Skybracer kept fighting with demons until his blood was drained and his life ran out. The blood that he lost in the battle turned into the Bishui River, and Mt. Tianheng still stands tall and proud to this day because of Skybracer’s feat.\nThe Mingxiao Lantern was dedicated to Skybracer during the Traveler’s first Lantern Rite festival.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
