This is great.\nI should still keep an eye on the surrounding soil environment, though. Looks like I'll have to place a few more instruments...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nDid something happen here?\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nAh, are you the Traveler? Could you spare a moment? I could really... use a favor from you.\nPlease allow me to introduce myself first. I'm Woliu, a hydrologist. I'm currently conducting some investigations in Chenyu Vale for research purposes.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nWhy would a hydrologist need to keep an eye on the soil environment?\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nThat's a very good question. The short answer is that the study of hydrology concerns more than just the movement of water.\nThe mountainous terrain, the flow of the streams, the geology of the land, the weather of the area, and even the daily lives of the human residents who call this place their home... they all affect the hydrology of the vale.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nP—Paimon can't say she really understands, but that definitely sounds super complicated...\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nIt is indeed quite complicated. Still, conducting research here is far easier than conducting research in Fontaine.\nI kept running into all kinds of problems trying to place even a single hydrology device in Fontaine. They'd get attacked by the aquatic wildlife one day, and be swept away by the currents the next...\nAnd that's not even going into all of those underwater mechanical things that archons-know-who placed down there... Ugh, just remembering all of this is giving me a headache.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSo, about the favor you'd like to ask of us...\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nAh, that... Well, it's really a small thing. I'd like to request that you help me place these monitoring instruments on that mountain.\nI have just ordered these mechanical instruments from Fontaine. Once placed, they will continuously bore down through the earth until they've obtained the deep soil samples that I require.\nWith those samples, I'll be able to measure the influence the local hydrology has had on the soil quality of the nearby mountains.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That sounds straightforward enough.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's been a while since we got such a simple commission.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nIf that's... what you think. I've been meaning to hire a few adventurers for the task, but no one has accepted my commission so far, and I've heard that there are a lot of Treasure Hoarders in the area...\nBut judging from your looks, you're not at all scared of those bullies, are you?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Just leave them to me.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>If they're smart, they should be scared of me.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nThen, I leave the placement of the instruments to you. All you need is to place them on the nearby hill.\nI still need to stay here to adjust some more instruments. Just come back to me once you've placed the batch that I've given you.\nObtain"

Maybe I'll take a look by the drawbridge in a bit.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Help Woliu set up the device</color>\nSet up the device nearby the Teleport Waypoint\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nD—Don't look down! It's so high up here. Let's just get out of here once we've placed the instruments!\nSet up the device at the slope\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm... Would this place do? Ah well, let's just trust that this device will do its job.\nFinish setting up both devices\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWell, that should be enough! Let's go back and find Woliu. It's not every day that we just get a simple commission like this, hehe. Easy-peasy, eh?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Report back to Woliu</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\n...These adjustments ought to do it.\nAh, have you placed the instruments already? Thank you so much.\nOnce I'm done placing this one, I'll give you your reward.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nYou could have just given it to me alongside the rest of the batch.\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nThank you for your kindness. Unfortunately, this instrument is somewhat special. It requires some additional adjustments and calibrating, and I wouldn't want to trouble you that much.\nLet's go to that cliff over there and place it, then I'll give you your reward.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat sounds really hard... Have you always worked like this?\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nHaha, at least now, I only need to place my instruments down on the ground. In a previous expedition, I actually had to figure out a way to place one in the middle of a raging river...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nCouldn't you just take a boat over there?\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nI mean, if all I needed to do was to drop the instrument, then sure, I could have just taken a boat, dropped it in the middle of the river, and left...\nBut I was trying to measure the intensity of the water flow, so I had to keep that specialized instrument stationary within the heart of the stream so that it would neither float to the top nor sink to the bottom...\nThankfully, there was a drawbridge above that river. Had there not been a bridge, I'd have had to ask some people to help me draw a rope between the two mountains...\nAnd then hang the device onto one of the ropes, before using another rope to move it to the center of the river and drop it in the water.\nAnyway... There's no point talking about that now. It's not like that's something we'll have to deal with... That said, we'll still pass by a drawbridge on our way to our destination.\nCome this way. That drawbridge isn't far from here.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Go with Woliu</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nHmm... It should be over this way. The scenery here is quite excellent, so we can take our time.\nEven professional photographers have been known to come all the way out here, just to get a shot of the beautiful scenery.\nYou'll be able to get a great view of the surrounding vistas from on top of the bridge.\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color>\nHelp! Is anyone there? Help!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Defeat all the Treasure Hoarders</color>\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color>\nGuard that other end well, brother! Let's see how much further they can run!\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color>\nUgh, I'm so tired... Why do I have to cut off their escape path?\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color>\nHelp! Help!!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTh—They are... Ah well, never mind that now! Let's save them first!\nGo to the other side of the bridge\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThere are Treasure Hoarders on both sides of the bridge... Be careful, Traveler!\n<color=#ffffff>After chasing away the Treasure Hoarders, you bring the people they cornered to a nearby pavilion to catch their breath.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nThank you, I really don't know how to express my gratitude...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nYou are... Ms. Qiu?\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nAh... It's you, Traveler! Well, fancy running into you again! This is really... This is the second time that you've done me such a huge favor!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWeren't you guys in Fontaine learning how to shoot a film? How are you already back in Liyue?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nHave you already mastered the art of filmmaking?\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\nWell, rather than that...\n<color=#ffffff>Xingye:</color>\nIt'd probably be more accurate to say we've been forced to make some quick Mora first.\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nYou two...\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\nMr. Geisert is indeed a master filmmaker, and he's given us a lot of very useful advice. However...\n<color=#ffffff>Xingye:</color>\nThe films that he's helped us shoot have all really focused on big ideas and themes. As for the actual plot, or the world and things that were intended to be featured...\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\nThey kind of... In Mr. Geisert's words, they were \"left behind the scenes.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Xingye:</color>\nBut we had looked into filmmaking in the first place to create a film that could bring attention to Chenyu Vale's excellent teas. If we had stayed with Mr. Geisert, we would have gone nowhere. So...\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nSo! I made the executive decision to put a pause on our studies and come back to shoot a documentary. We will use this opportunity to put our knowledge to the test!\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\n...Well, and because we'd just about run out of funds.\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nH—Hey, haven't I told you about my plan already? As long as this documentary becomes a smash hit, we'll make our investment back in no time.\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\nWell, and then we found ourselves cornered by Treasure Hoarders on a drawbridge. Thankfully, the great Traveler came to save us.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Isn't this place... a bit far from Qiaoying Village?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>But why are you here if you want to photograph Qiaoying Village?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\n*sigh* Well, I wanted to get some majestic shots of the scenery, so the film would look a bit more imposing...\nBut we got a bit too distracted while shooting and caught the attention of those Treasure Hoarders. We fled all the way here but were still cornered by them in the end...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWait, so the \"pro photographers\" Woliu mentioned earlier were...\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nYep, they were Ms. Qiu and her assistants.\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nWh—Where did you suddenly just pop up from, Ms. Woliu? I—I swear I didn't see you at all before now...\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nI just hid myself very well.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nSo you already know each other...\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nI mean, Ms. Woliu is an expert hydrologist. No one knows these lands better than her.\nWe'd consulted her several times before this on the best places to shoot.\nWe've even tried to get her to join us! But she said that she could only consider once she's finished with her work.\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\nBoss, um... While we were running away earlier, we seemed to have, um, left the case containing our film and equipment on the ground...\n<color=#ffffff>Xingye:</color>\nI think... All the work that we've done so far is in that case...\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\n...\nMs. Woliu! Traveler! Paimon! Thank you for everything! Wh—When you are next free, please find me in Qiaoying Village!\nAfter all... You've saved our lives, so we've got to prepare a reward in return!\nBut for now, we must be off and away! Hurry! Where did we leave that box!? We need to go back for it!\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu and her assistants leave in a great hurry...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat film case... sure has gone through a lot...\n<color=#ffffff>Woliu:</color>\nThey say that good things often come at the end of many tribulations. I'm sure Ms. Qiu's film will turn out to be a hit.\nAnyway, let me give you your reward. I'll go place my final instrument shortly, and then... probably go check on Ms. Qiu to see how she's doing.\nI've got to find her fast, or she'll probably be off archon-knows-where again, shooting her film.\nHmm, I suppose she did just say that she can be found at Qiaoying Village. I'll just go check that out later.\nObtain"

We're currently a little short on money. As a master filmmaker, Mr. Geisert's tuition doesn't exactly come cheap...\nEven though we've already shot a few smaller films, and made some Mora from that, a feature film of this length just burns through your budget as if it's nothing.\n<color=#ffffff>Xingye:</color>\nEspecially since Boss also turned down a few potential sponsors.\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\nAnd refused many invitations to collaborate.\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nHey, what do you two know!?

And then wait here!\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Ms. Qiu, Yifeng and Xingye\n<color=#ffffff>Xingye:</color>\nBoss, just how long are we going to wait here? We've been shooting for such a long time already...\n<color=#ffffff>Yifeng:</color>\nBoss, I really feel like luck's not on our side today regarding this shot...\n<color=#ffffff>Ms. Qiu:</color>\nJ—Just wait for a little more.
