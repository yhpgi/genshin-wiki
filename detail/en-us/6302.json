            "text": "...\nWise Antonio, in the basement\nof the crumbling house,\nbegan reading the ancient book\nhe had found. His oil\nlamp shook from time to time\nas the swaying structure above-ground\ncollapsed.\nThe village was to be symbolically razed\nby the dragon, and he\nhad been chosen by the dragon,\nfor he had not returned home. But\nAntonio did not care.\nHe only wished to study\nthe book the old lady had given him\non the bridge he passed today.\nThis book was titled the\n\"Radiant█C█arter,\" and within\nwas re█or██d all the rules that\nevery bei███in Simulanka\nmust follow. It was written in the language\nof world's creation at the very start,\nand if Antonio was not possessed of\nextraordinary wisdom, and deciphered this\nprimordial text, there would have been\nno study to be had.\nThis book recorded no solutions\nas to resolving the difficulty\nthat Constellation Satellite\npresently faced, nor did it contain\nany hexes that could aid\nAntonio in repairing his own home.\nBut he knew\nthat wisdom was the mightiest thing\nin the world.\nThe morning light shone through\nthe ruins of his home, and the neighboring\nblacksmith and chubby chief took\ngreat pains to get rid of the house's\nwreckage, which blocked the basement hatch.\nWith dark circles about his eyes,\nAntonio said to the chubby chief:\n\"I shall defeat the dragon.\nI will return soon.\"\n\"Are you sure you're alright?\nYou don't look like you got any sleep.\"\n\"Just smoke from the oil lamp.\nDon't worry about it.\"\n...\nThe dragon sat atop a mountain\nof treasures, gazing down\nat insignificant little Antonio walking\ncloser. Flames gathered\nin its throat, preparing to burn\nthe area one centimeter before him,\nall the better to scare this puny,\nfoolish creature away.\n\"Halt! I'm a qualified 2nd-class Meister!\nThe 'Radiant Charter' states that\nshould I refuse a duel, you cannot\nuse force.\"\nThis restriction did indeed exist,\nand so the wicked dragon\nswallowed its flames whole — ah, how it\ndreaded going to the toilet tomorrow.\nAntonio, for his part, had not expected\nthat the 2nd-class\nrust-clearing Meister qualification exam he\nhad taken on a lark would come in useful.\n\"And since I am a 2nd-class\nMeister, I propose\na duel of riddles. You cannot refuse!\"\nNow, Simulanka had just such a law, mainly\nfor the benefit of sphinxes, old sages, and\nprincesses who wished to make life hard for\nothers. The evil dragon had not expected\nthis rule to catch up with it.\n\"I shall ask the first question:\nMy house sold for 8,000 Mora yesterday\nBut I thought there was room\nto raise the price, so I\nbought it back for 9,000,\nplanning to sell it for 10,000.\nHow much Mora did I lose in the end?\"\nThe dragon laughed in contempt.\n\"What's so hard about that?\nYou could have waited until\nit hit 10,000 to make your move,\nBut you sold for 8,\nand bought for 9, so you\nlost 1,000 Mora, that you\ncould have earned instead!\"\n\"Wrong. You burned my house\ndown yesterday, and I couldn't\nsell it in time, so I've lost far more.\"\n\"S—Sorry. I mean,\nI do have to burn a house, and you\nhappened not to be home,\nso I might as well hit one that doesn't\nresult in any loss of life.\"\n\"Now that you've lost this\ncontest, I have the right\nto loot of the same value\nas your life, minus 1 Mora.\nAnd considering that\nyou've burned my house, I can\nseek damages. Let's assume that\nmy house is worth just 1 Mora...\nWell, then, wicked dragon,\nyou know what to do with yourself.\"\n\"P—Please spare me. I'll give you\nanything!\"\n\"Your words, not mine,\" Antonio said\nas he pulled out a contract\nhe had written long ago.\n...\nThus did Antonio use his\nwisdom to take all the evil\ndragon's treasures.\nThe dragon, devastated, would never\nagain return to attack\nConstellation Satellite,\nwhere Antonio lived.\nMany years later, a child asked Antonio:\n\"You sold your place for 8,000\nand spent 9,000 buying it back,\nso it looks like you actually\ndid lose 1,000 Mora?\"\nA.A."
