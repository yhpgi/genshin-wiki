They were as good a group of friends as Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama.\nBut one of the friends returned to the earth, while the remaining two went their separate ways.\nOne was determined to create a kingdom on earth and cause all sorrow to disappear,\nWhile the other decided to spread vegetation and greenery and fill the land with wisdom and happiness.\nBut eventually, kingdoms will fall, wisdom will be distorted, and the definition of happiness will change.\nYou will forget your dreams, while we will recoil back to ours, forgetting the sun and moon.\nEven so, in the depths of the desert, just as the kings of the forest leave footprints behind, and you and I leave stories behind,\nThe traces of our past friendship are said to slumber quietly, like an Aranara that has transformed into a seed."
