If a recommended artifact lineup that matches the filter cannot be generated, then one without any Set Bonus will simply be generated based on recommended Main Affixes, at which point some unexpected combinations may occur. If a lineup cannot be generated even so, then some part(s) of the result may turn up empty, or the player may be unable to create any lineup at all.\n<color=#ffffff>Custom Configuration</color> data will be saved based on the settings laid out for each character.\nWhen using a Custom Configuration, the player can edit the following:\n1. Main Affix: Only artifacts that match the correct Main Affix will be selected. When the player edit a Custom Configuration, the player needs to at least select the Main Affix for the Sands of Eon, Goblet of Eonothem, and Circlet of Logos.\n2. Set Type: Selecting 1 artifact set will generate a lineup that contains a 4-piece set of artifacts from that set. Selecting 2 artifact sets will generate a lineup that contains two 2-piece sets from those set types. If the player does not select an artifact set, the player will not be limited to any artifact set in lineup generation, but again, unexpected combinations may occur.\n3. Minor Affixes: The player can select priority and secondary Minor Affixes, up to a maximum of 3. Minor Affixes at the same priority tier will be selected for in no particular order.\n4. Recommend Stats: When usable data exists, the Recommend Stats function can be used. The Recommend Stats function will automatically sort and add main affixes, Artifact Set type, and minor affixes to the current lineup based on data gathered from recently active players.\n5. Other: The player can also select whether or not to use artifacts that are not equipped on any other character. This decision will affect the generation process.\nAt the generation process, if the player's Inventory does not contain artifacts that match the player's Main Affix filter, such that the player will not be able to generate 4-piece sets or 2-piece sets of their preference, there is a chance that the generation process will fail. At this time, the player may adjust the filters and try again. When previewing affixes for the player's plan, the various attributes of the character will only account for their own stats plus weapons and artifacts, and will not take the current party's Elemental Resonance, Ley Line Disorders, or other conditions into account. If the player's current filters have Minor Affix priority, then the candidate artifacts will be sorted with reference to said filters.\nThe \"Recommended Configurations\" function includes a \"Check Alternatives\" feature, allowing you to swap Artifacts with other suggested options. There are two preset configurations in \"Custom Configuration,\" and a \"Recommended Order Scope of Effect\" setting in the sorting function, which can be set to \"Current Slot\" or \"All Slots.\""
