            "text": "Songs have long circulated in Chenyu Vale that tell of an ancient cave within which a demon lord from a past beyond reckoning once hid. They say that she wore a skirt of coagulated jade-blood, and leaned on the long-destroyed lunar chariot, submerged and slumbering beneath a black, bottomless pool of water. In these eons that memory has nigh forgotten, she was the mistress of Chenyu Vale, who ruled the birds and beasts and adepti of wild mountain nature, who controlled the ebb and flow of the Bishui River, who as an arbiter maintained the natural balance between mortals and animals. But those are tales from long ago, and though both folk indigenous and migrant tell tales of how she started a war out of incurable obsession, before ultimately being defeated, sealed, and plunged into deathly, dreaming slumber, the relevant historical details can now no longer be verified.\nThe sole piece of evidence that supports this tale is this song of lamentation that Chenyu Vale locals once sang:\n\"Though I wish to gift you herbs, who shall leave it at the sandbank amidst the waters?\"\n\"Where now fly the godly banners? The chariot is lost in the lightless bamboo wood.\"\n\"How terrible the Xuanwen wail, who think upon the darkened pool.\"\nDo the proud descendants of the mountain folk yet remember and memorialize their lost god? The most vivid tales have been eroded by flowing time, now only faintly visible in song, like green jade only faintly discernable beneath the waters of a stream. So perhaps, just as a lost boatman once witnessed, one might still hear an ancient heart beating, its jade blood pumping, echoing in those boundless depths?"
