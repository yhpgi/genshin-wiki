Yet, it was through her noble sacrifice that we ultimately thwarted Rotwang and prevented the loss of countless lives. Now, I finally understand why she pretended to be my close companion. I hope to speak with you about this in greater detail when next we meet — though perhaps, by then, you will already know more about all this than I.\nI shall not presume to judge, nor shall I attempt to alter your opinion of her. But I ask, if nothing else, that you allow me to honor Miss Alia's final wishes by sharing her words with you. She asked that I render all possible support to you (which I surely will. You are my benefactor, after all), and that — I relay this only as she spoke it — she hoped that you would go on to live a life of happiness and freedom.\nAs for the Arrow of Terpikeraunas you mentioned in your last letter, if it truly holds the power to dispel the pitch-black calamity, and if you are willing to share it with such selflessness, then on behalf of the people of Nod-Krai, please accept my deepest gratitude. Should, as you foresee, Rotwang indeed rise again from the pitch-black filth, then our successors — an order I am considering naming the \"Lightkeepers,\" in honor of the flame you have kindled — will stand ready to vanquish the threat once more, armed with the technology you have so generously gifted us.\nWe can speak of the details in person whenever you are free. I understand all too well that, after Lovia's passing, the Frostmoon Scions have been left with countless matters demanding your attention.\nYours sincerely,\nSolovei"
