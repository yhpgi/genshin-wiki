They now wander ruins and ancient detritus, attacking offending travelers. Research indicates that the Ruin Guards and the ruins they operate in do not originate from the same source, suggesting that there may be a difference of as much as several thousand years between them on the timeline. So why then do the Ruin Guards continue staying among these ruins, using their \"explosive firepower\" to protect the crumbling walls and broken tiles?",

The atmosphere here is so calm and relaxed, so slow and comfortable.\"\n\"I recently went to the Thousand Winds Temple in the east. I heard it was a sanctuary where people used to worship the wind a long time ago. Pretty cool huh? I can't really imagin how our ancestors were able to build such a magnificent structure.\"\n\"However, there is a gigantic Ruin Guard inside â€” absolutely frightening. At first, I thought it was an abandoned ancient structure, but when I got close it swiftly stood up and prepared to attack me. Needless to say, I ran for my life.\"\n\"There's a crazy monster in the precious ruins that can fire homing missiles! Hurting people is bad enough, but imagine what that could do to the ruins! Anyway, if you insist on going to the Thousand Winds Temple for a tour, look out for missiles!\"\nCat's Tail's reply\nWe really hope you'll like our city. If you are willing to take the time to come by, Cat's Tail will make sure to welcome you with an exquisite drink, cleansing you of all the bad mojo you encountered on your journey."
