So this bow was some powerful weapon used to hunt and kill these mighty machine creatures, and so it was the apex predator of that world.\nBut the strange girl corrected him.\nShe was just going to use this to hunt wild boars next, since it appeared that in this world, using bows and arrows to hunt would actually allow one to harvest Raw Meat."
