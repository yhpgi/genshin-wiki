Commit atrocities in the name of false promises?\"\n\"Therefore, I bid you—\"\n\"Cast it all aside, set it at naught, drench your wings in filth — let the love that blazes in our breasts burst forth.\"\n\"Hunger, thirst, yearn, desire! Entrust the world to those who live in it — let the nations' glory exceed that of the heavens.\"\n\"Sing and rejoice! Bestow upon humanity authority — let the lances of lunar light pierce the creator's delusions.\"\n\"Reach for that daybreak pristine, where the nations need beg for leave to live no longer!\"\n\"Lift up your eyes to the radiant daystars, let me guide us unto new skies.\"\n\"The moment shall come when the ruler who stands against love is shaken,\"\n\"And once the veil is sundered and torn, a new day over this land shall dawn.\""
