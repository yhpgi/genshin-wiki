We can't get through!\nQuest Objective: Look for clues near the dark fog\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Huh. Who left this bag behind? Maybe we can get some useful info from its contents!\nQuest Objective: Read the logs\n<color=#ffffff>Fatuus' Journal:</color> ...Staff Sergeant Anton has discovered a large bell to the southeast. The rock walls have their\" script all over it...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Fatuus' Journal:</color> ...This is very similar to the large bell that the Captain discovered in the ruins to the northwest. Perhaps...\n<color=#ffffff>Fatuus' Journal:</color> ...We dispatched Snezhevna and Fadeyka to ring the two bells in their respective corners...\n<color=#ffffff>Fatuus' Journal:</color> ...As the terrifying tolls reverberated through the stone, the black fog dissipated.

The Captain ordered a retreat...\n<color=#ffffff>Fatuus' Journal:</color> (A simple map falls out from the diary.

Whoa! The bell has been covered in the dark mud...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Will tolling this bell really cause the black fog to disperse?\nRing the northwestern bell\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Whoa!
