Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.\nBut one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.\nAnd with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.\nUpon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\"\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\nIn the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?\n\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\""

She didn't always have a penchant for madness, you know.\nIt's the name of the Ruler of Life.\nAunt Alice told me about it not too long ago. But, it came as no surprise. I knew Master would do it sooner or later.\nAs for the \"Ruler of Life,\" all I truly know is this: Naberius is not gone. Instead, because of Master's actions, she and Naberius are now one."
