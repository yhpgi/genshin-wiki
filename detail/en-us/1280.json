Their voices won't be carried by the wind anymore. My expectations towards them, as well as the faith they have in me, will all fall through.\"<br/>\"Once again I'll climb this peak looking for guidance. By the time I'm back down, my daughter will have finished the second painting.\"<br/>\"As long as the third one will be of thawing snow and ice, everything will be fine.\"",
