Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her grandpa's head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro Slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.\nSomehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.\nTo Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.\nBut it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years."

He came from Liyue Harbor and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed Teyvat. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack; he was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.\nToo ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.\nBefore long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.\nIt also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and founded a family.\nYears later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the outriders; at night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.\nAmber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew.\n\"When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?\"\nAs the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response."

In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.\nOn top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.\nAmber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.\nShe had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage — and lots of it.\nShe wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.\nBut more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland."

Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same.\n\"For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!\"\nAmber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.\nShe firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa."
