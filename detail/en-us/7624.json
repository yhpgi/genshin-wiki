While improving the industry's technology and techniques, she has successfully lowered the costs involved, effectively democratizing high-end dining and putting famous dishes on the tables of ordinary folk.\nAccording to her students and peers, she is discipline incarnate. There is no slacking on her watch — even the tiniest mistakes caused by a lapse in concentration or momentary distraction are met with scathing critiques. Crafting a dish worthy of even a perfunctory nod of approval requires absolute respect for each ingredient and the utmost sincerity and caution at every stage of the cooking process.\nAs Navia and her other friends see it, Escoffier is a patient and thoughtful woman who finds inspiration in complex symphonies and conversations with companions alike. Joining her for a spot of afternoon tea is much like opening a surprise gift — there is always something new and unexpected in store.\nYet for Escoffier, there is no dwelling on past glories — in her eyes, there is only the now and her goals for the future.\nEven when tasting a creation into which she has poured her heart and soul, she only stops to enjoy her work for a fleeting moment before turning her attention to the tiniest of flaws that even a seasoned critic would fail to notice.\n\"There's still a long way to go to achieve perfection!\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 2</color>\nEscoffier displayed an unusually keen awareness from an early age... almost shockingly so.\nHer sense of taste was particularly sharp, a characteristic that combined with her natural curiosity to remarkable effect.\nWhen her parents were distracted, she would rush into the kitchen and try every ingredient and seasoning she could find. She would then categorize them based on whether they were sweet, savory, sour, or spicy, and neatly rearrange them based on flavor intensity. She would then gesture to her mother to point out which flavors she preferred.\nWhile other children were playing aimlessly and carefree, Escoffier was busy discerning which baguettes had been out of the oven for too long and were no longer fresh. She would eagerly signal her mother to replace these stale loaves with freshly-baked ones. Seeing her little arms waving and her eyes blinking furiously, her mother would cut her off a few extra pieces of bread and ladle her a fresh bowl of soup, mistakenly believing she was trying to signal her hunger.\nOf course, Escoffier's parents weren't so well off that they could afford to throw out bread the second it lost its freshness. And so Escoffier, then only two, learned how to use salt, butter, sugar, and pepper to create fresh flavors for every meal.\nWatching this unfold, her parents, themselves chefs, realized their daughter's particular interest. So, they provided her ever more seasonings to play with, giving her the tools and freedom to express her creativity.\nIn whatever free time they had between teaching their daughter poetry and art, Escoffier's parents would introduce the history of cooking, inculcating in her the solemn significance of being a chef — starting with the adage that \"The pristine white of a chef's uniform shines as brilliant as the plumage of a snow-winged goose.\"\nIt wasn't long before Escoffier was completely immersed in the wonderful world of food. She asked her parents to take her along to work, sitting and observing from the quietest corner of the restaurant. With the owner's permission, they would make a little extra sample with each dish they cooked so that the curious Escoffier could taste every style and flavor.\nThey were as yet unaware that in Escoffier's mind, this was nothing less than diligent study.\nThis exceptional talent would only continue to evolve and improve until she attained an awe-inspiring virtuosity.\nNo matter what dish was put before her, with just a single taste and a few minutes of careful consideration, Escoffier could not only list each ingredient and seasoning but even estimate the amounts used.\nEventually, at the ripe old age of four, she took a decisive step on her culinary journey — identifying ingredients and flavoring food was no longer enough. She was determined to start cooking dishes that could satisfy her tastes — to create cuisine that would shock the world!\n\"How about I make dinner tonight?\"\nFor her first ever dish, Escoffier eschewed the more common starting points and attempted a Golden Trinity Roulade — fish, poultry, and offal coated in batter and fried until a wondrous, golden interplay of complex flavors was achieved.\nThis was by no means an easy dish to make. Only by preparing each ingredient with care and precision could the correct balance of flavors be achieved. The slightest inaccuracy could easily result in a dish that is torment for the tongue.\nEscoffier followed the recipe to a T, carefully measuring each ingredient and seasoning and strictly controlling the timing of each stage. Her tiny hands were a blur of activity, anxiety turning her face red as she spent a hectic two hours toiling away.\nHer first, somewhat clumsy attempt at cookery did not have a fairytale ending — this was no case of the genius chef destined to turn every dish she touched into culinary gold.\nWhile her parents were full of praise for her Golden Trinity Roulade — enthusing quite genuinely over their meal — once they left and Escoffier had tried it herself, a frown quickly spread across her face.\nShe had failed to cook a dish that she found truly satisfying.\n\"There's something missing, a certain je ne sais quoi...\"\nThat night, Escoffier lay in bed thinking, unable to sleep...\n\"Perhaps... I haven't eaten enough food... I haven't prepared enough meals... Was my seasoning off?\"\n\"Reading a recipe and following the instructions as-is... It's not enough!\"\nFrom that point on, Escoffier had a clear goal to work towards...\nShe would try more food, expand her culinary horizons, and create delicacies that would make the world gasp in awe!"

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 3</color>\n\"Expand my culinary horizons\"... Such a simple goal, and yet, one that required considerable expenditure.\nWishing to avoid burdening her parents, Escoffier decided to embark on a culinary campaign despite her young age.\nShe found a nondescript restaurant far from the prying eyes of anyone who might recognize her and diligently worked her way up to an apprenticeship in the kitchens.\nBy observing the chefs as they cooked dish after dish — all while helping them complete vital steps in the preparation process — Escoffier quickly familiarized herself with the specific challenges posed by wide varieties of food.\nWhenever a customer was less than satisfied, Escoffier would try a sample of their dish and combine her own taste with her memories of how the chef had cooked it to analyze the problem.\nAt the same time, mistakes are inevitable amidst the kitchen's heat, and stove-side pitfalls are impossible to predict from staring at recipes and textbooks alone.\nThe chefs in Escoffier's restaurant already thought she was too young to work in the kitchen. So, even when she knocked over a pot full of food, they couldn't bring themselves to scold her.\nBut Escoffier requested she receive no special treatment — every harsh word, every sharp reprimand, she wanted to hear them all.\nIf she didn't like what they said, then it was her job not to make the same mistake again.\nIt was these unpredictable pitfalls that Escoffier needed to quickly identify and commit to memory, adding them to her growing pool of \"experience\".\nIn a short six months, her understanding of cooking had grown by leaps and bounds, and she was soon ready to cook the restaurant's signature dishes unsupervised.\nThis tiny apprentice, barely taller than the stovetop, would stand on a chair, wielding utensils that weighed half as much as she did, and produce dish after dish of remarkable quality.\nSeeing this, the restaurant owner was moved by her passion and granted Escoffier the title of \"petit chef.\" Her apprenticeship was over, and she was given a salary to match her new position.\nAlmost all the Mora that Escoffier earned in those early days was spent on \"sampling delicacies.\"\nEvery day off they had, she would invite her parents to visit the famous restaurants of the Court of Fontaine, sampling each establishment's most exceptional offerings.\nWhile her parents were busy enthusing over the novel flavors of this high-end cuisine, Escoffier was deep in contemplation, considering the steps that must have been taken to prepare each dish and committing to memory every last spark of inspiration.\nThe more delicious food she tried, the more her own cooking excelled, the more Mora she could earn, and the more delicious food she could try... As Escoffier spiraled ever upward on this culinary cycle, she became increasingly engrossed in the grandness of gastronomy.\nBut there was one delicacy that she had been unable to sample...\nThe legendary Gateau Debord had swept through the culinary world like wildfire only a hundred years before. Yet, after the untimely death of the Hotel Debord's original head chef, the recipe had vanished from history.\nLater generations had made repeated attempts to reconstruct the recipe from scattered records of the time. Many of these replicas had themselves made waves in the culinary circles of Fontaine.\nEscoffier had tried them all, and while they were indeed sweet and delicious, she was always left with an inexpressible sense of disappointment — surely, there was more to the legendary cake than this?\nAround Escoffier's fifth birthday, a great chef from the Spina di Rosula created another such replica, one that was rumored to be almost identical in taste to the original.\nThe Spina even arranged for the Hotel Debord itself to host a grand tasting ceremony, whose opening day just so happened to fall on Escoffier's birthday.\nThere would be a mere sixteen pieces on offer each day. Naturally, these were quickly reserved for famous celebrities and people of note — there was no hope of securing a taste for someone like Escoffier, no matter how much she might desire it.\nOn the day of her fifth birthday, Escoffier begged her parents to take her to the Hotel Debord. Even if she couldn't try it, perhaps she could learn something about the legendary gateau just from its color, shape, and smell.\nIn the end, unforeseeable events conspired to provide her with far more than just a glimpse and a whiff of fragrance — outside the hotel, a sudden gust swept up an exquisite hat and whisked it into Escoffier's hands.\nShe searched high and low until, finally, following the unmistakable scent of roses wafting from the hat, she managed to find its equally fragrant owner — a somewhat anxious Navia.\nBy way of thanks, Navia invited Escoffier to sample the delightful piece of cake that had been reserved specially for her by the great chef who had baked it.\n\"Honestly, it's nothing! I'll let you in on a little secret...\" Navia lowered her voice and, after making sure no one was listening, whispered to the hesitant Escoffier, \"I've tried it loads of times when no one was looking... and personally, I prefer macarons!\"\nWith that, Escoffier's curiosity overcame her polite hesitancy, and she eagerly dug into the cake that Navia had just handed her.\nIt was indeed delicious, yet far from perfection. To Escoffier's tastes, it was no better or worse than the other imitations she had tried.\nBut this was a coveted gift from a new friend standing right in front of her — not to mention the work of a chef from the organization said friend's family ran... Was this the time for an honest appraisal?\n\"How is it? Do you like it? Tell me what you really think!\"\nNavia's appeal erased any lingering doubt. When facing a friend — when facing food — only the truth will do.\nAnd so, as she would go on to do countless times in the years to come, Escoffier gave her frank, exacting assessment:\n\"...It's nothing special.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4</color>\nA vast and formidable gulf must be bridged for the merely \"exquisite\" to be elevated to the \"enchanting.\"\nAfter carefully analyzing and comparing the many imitations she had tried over the years, Escoffier decided that she too would attempt to recreate the Gateau Debord she had so long dreamed of.\nShe would attempt to use this stunning creation as a stepping stone to ascend to the pinnacle of the culinary world.\nWith no recipe to follow, she had no choice but to cycle through the more common ingredients, hoping to slowly \"derive\" the perfect flavor.\nIf taking an existing recipe and learning how to prepare it, then modifying and improving upon what was already there can be compared to building a house with a tried-and-tested blueprint before decorating it in a different style...\nThen, Escoffier's method of \"derivation\" should be compared to building an entirely new house from scratch.\nShould an ingredient lend a dish an unexpected flavor, or if the proportions of each component are slightly off, the structure will topple, and the entire dish must be rebuilt from the ground up.\nTo this end, on top of her regular work at the restaurant, Escoffier started taking on \"custom orders,\" where customers would provide her with ingredients and requirements, and she would craft dishes for them that were not on the menu.\nDoing so allowed her to push beyond her comfort zone and learn to adapt to unexpected requests. By familiarizing herself with a variety of ingredients in the heat of battle — continuously experimenting with new pairings and combinations — she could uncover both the original and latent flavors of every ingredient.\nYears passed in unending experimentation and refinement, as Escoffier created a detailed \"Flavor Profile Chart\" and developed her own unique culinary philosophy.\nShe named her new school of cooking \"precision gastronomy.\" It was a style unfettered by a set repertoire of ingredients but instead grounded in understanding the fundamental flavor of each component. She honed in on precise measurements and analysis of the reactions occurring at each stage of the cooking process to create a truly bottom-up approach to cooking.\nAt this point, Escoffier finally felt as though she had — if only barely — joined the ranks of the cooking establishment. From this moment on, she poured all her effort into advancing the frontiers of food and challenging the boundaries of perfection.\nBy harnessing the principles of her budding precision gastronomy, Escoffier successfully created a new dessert that was not simply exquisite but truly enchanting.\nBenefiting from the popularity of her earlier \"custom orders,\" her new cake took the Court of Fontaine by storm, flying off countertops throughout the city.\nIt caused such a stir that news of this new sweet treat made its way to Furina, whose curiosity was piqued. In between performances, she took the time to visit Escoffier's restaurant and see what the fuss was all about.\nWhen Furina appeared at the restaurant, the whole scene fell silent. Knives and forks stopped in mid air as diners stared in shock, while the chefs' hands were trembling so much that they were unable to continue cooking.\nOnly Escoffier quickly regained her composure after a brief moment of shock. It was she who greeted Furina with earnest elegance and, after a few seconds of careful preparation, delivered her new signature dessert to the superstar's table.\nIt was then that Furina noticed a peculiar emotion in Escoffier's eyes.\nFervor? No... it was like she was entranced.\nIt was as though this young chef had been waiting for just such an opportunity. Every dish she prepared was given her absolute care and attention — and now that she had the chance to present her food to the Hydro Archon herself, she seemed like someone stepping into the spotlight, eagerly awaiting Furina's verdict.\nNow even more curious than ever, Furina picked up her knife and fork and began to hum a lilting melody as the delicate flavors of the Lily Sugar-Glazed Opera Cake danced on her tongue like the notes of a sweet symphony.\nWhen she had finished, Furina immediately broke out into enthusiastic praise. She carefully confirmed the source of each sweet sensation and twice asked Escoffier's name before leaving.\nThat night, Escoffier couldn't sleep. To have suddenly received such praise from Furina left her feeling like she was in a dream — a dream so wonderful she could hardly believe it was real...\nIf she awoke, would she ever be able to relive this fantasy?\nThe answer, it turned out, was yes. The next day, she received an envelope from the Palais Mermonia. Inside was a letter of special appointment.\n...\nMany years later, when Furina discussed her first meeting with Escoffier at a tea party, she recounted how amazed she was at the young chef's assured demeanor and composed grace.\nAt that moment, Escoffier displayed a rare lapse of composure yet managed to retain her customary frankness as she responded:\n\"To be honest, my mind went completely blank. I was cooking purely on instinct.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 5</color>\n\"Dearest Escoffier, your superlative dessert brought me so much joy yesterday! Your wonderful talents are simply unrivalled...\"\n\"To this end, I have decided to appoint you as my personal 'Patissiere Supreme'!\"\nIn a reception room at the Palais Mermonia, Furina personally placed an exquisite chef's hat on Escoffier's head, awarded her with a commemorative badge — one of Furina's own design — and bestowed upon her a title with no equal in the culinary world.\nFor Escoffier, this was the ultimate encouragement — a position of great responsibility in Furina's court. She could feel the pride in her heart surge like a tidal wave of motivation.\nAnd with it, her resolve grew, too — she was determined to keep creating dishes that would satisfy her new patron.\nHowever, even the Palais Mermonia had a budget to keep, and a well-fitted kitchen was seen as an expense too far. What facilities there were would only allow for the preparation of simple dishes, with no way for Escoffier to fully express her culinary genius.\nAs a result, she needed a fully-equipped restaurant where she could prepare Furina's desserts before carefully packaging them, sealing them, and delivering them to her master's table.\nFortunately, the Hotel Debord extended a timely offer, creating the new role of \"Technical Head Chef\" especially for her. She was now nominally on a par with the hotel's head chef and could freely use even the rarest and most expensive ingredients to create unparalleled dishes for Lady Furina.\nIt was a mutually beneficial arrangement. Escoffier gained access to the finest equipment and ingredients, while each of her prestigious desserts now bore a label reading \"Creation of the Hotel Debord\" — further cementing the establishment's reputation throughout Fontaine.\nWhat the hotel seemed to have overlooked, however, was that Escoffier was no simple pastry chef, and her culinary talents stretched far beyond the boundaries of the sweet. After all, Furina could hardly be expected to eat cream, frosting, and fruit filling for three meals a day — she required her Patissiere Supreme to dabble in the realm of the savory, too.\nAnd so it was that Escoffier spent this period of her life putting her talents into practice without restraint, honing her cooking skills until she had reached the peak of her craft.\nShe recreated the hotel's classic dishes with impeccable skill while improving upon many of their recipes, even reviving several others that had been thought lost to time.\nThe head chef at the time was a no-nonsense and experienced old hand who had already picked her chosen successor. However, upon seeing the advantages Escoffier held in all culinary domains, she decided to let the two younger chefs duel it out in friendly competition.\nEscoffier did not disappoint. She cooked a bowl of Wave-Kissed Sands — a dish that appears simple and unassuming at first glance but whose preparation is fraught with potential pitfalls. The dish left those who tasted it stunned, and even her rival was convinced that Escoffier should take her place as the new head chef.\nJust like that, she became the youngest head chef in Hotel Debord's history. The commemorative badge that Furina had given her — now a symbol of her personal image — would grow to embody the pinnacle of cutting-edge gastronomy.\nUnder her stewardship, the hotel's chefs pushed the limits of possibility, elevating the quality of every dish in their repertoire. Even the most pedantic of critics would find no fault in their food.\nAfter just six months in her post, Escoffier had reached the pinnacle of her profession. She was now recognized as Fontaine's most illustrious chef since Modeste — the hotel's \"genius\" founder.\nBut no journey through life is without roadblocks, and hers was no exception.\nAfter a while at the Hotel Debord, she discovered that her development had plateaued.\nEvery group of diners has its own unique \"food culture\" — an ingrained inertia shaped by time, history, and environment. These deeply rooted conventions were not something Escoffier could overturn on her own.\nFor example, a well-dressed couple of noble stock would find it just as hard to imagine taking up their finely polished knives and forks and digging into a mound of fish and chips as a thrifty worker would find it to nibble on foie gras with their family.\nBecause of this, the food that Escoffier could create while at the Hotel Debord was limited by the tastes and cultural horizons of her clientele.\nNot to mention, the dramatic influx of customers caused by the hotel's increased popularity put a huge strain on her, as she was now in charge of not only ensuring the quality of every dish but also managing the entire kitchen staff.\nAll of these factors conspired to restrict her exploration and experimentation with flavor.\nBut... could she really throw away the title of head chef that she had worked so hard to achieve — and abandon the hotel's unrivalled culinary environment — all to chase a hazy goal with no clear way forward?\nBefore Escoffier could make up her mind, an unexpected event decided her fate on her behalf.\nA dangerous and prohibited substance, lumiline, was found in the hotel's food. The news spread like wildfire throughout Fontaine, and her chefs were all in a panic.\nAs the head chef, Escoffier felt responsible for allowing the contamination to occur. To protect the hotel's reputation and calm unrest among the staff, she resigned her post. But it was not enough, and she found herself dragged before the court and sentenced.\nAll her doubts and frustrations would now have to accompany her to the lonely prison beneath the waves."

If anything, her brief stay in the Fortress of Meropide gave her a new sense of perspective. She would later jokingly refer to this time as her \"first period of seclusion\" — a time spent cultivating her skills.\nThe food at the Fortress of Meropide's Coupon Cafeteria — far from the haute cuisine she was used to — could generously be described as a lottery. One where the jackpot was a meal so bad it was like an extra sentence. And yet, it allowed her to consider the possibilities of precision gastronomy from a whole new angle.\nNo longer focused on recreating specific flavors or arriving at set results, she turned her attention to testing as many taste combinations as possible. Every ingredient had depths to be plumbed, each one capable of creating unthinkable flavors with the right companion, thereby granting access to a wider world of seasonings to be used.\nWith this newfound motivation, her underwater life no longer seemed so stifling — though she still felt a pang of regret:\nAt times, the Fortress of Meropide was as noisy as a factory assembly line, while at others, it was as quiet as the yawning void. Thinking back to the atmosphere of the Hotel Debord, where melodious music always filled the halls, left her deeply saddened.\nThen one day, Furina and Navia came to visit, bearing a small record player. To Escoffier, the lilting notes of songs she had once grown tired of were like the first drops of rain after a long drought. As she was reminded of all the dishes she had enjoyed while listening to these songs, a surge of inspiration welled up inside her.\nFrom this day forward, the lumiline case that had landed her in prison no longer held any real significance for her.\nThe very next day after leaving the Fortress of Meropide, Escoffier invited her friends — including Navia — to a banquet. She chose a song with an undulating melody and a soothing rhythm and let the music inspire her as she created a dozen or more dishes, each one greeted by astonished gasps from her guests. As for the new creation she sent to Lady Furina, named \"Autumn Frost,\" it was so well-received that Furina couldn't help but dance with joy.\nUpon her release, Escoffier did not return to the Hotel Debord. Instead, she settled into a peaceful life at a tavern by the Fleuve Cendre that Navia had recommended.\nThis was to be the beginning of her \"second period of seclusion.\" Only matters relating to food could be allowed to disturb her thoughts.\nEven the sudden arrival of a catastrophic flood could not distract her from her purpose — she would not leave on the rescue boats until all of her utensils and ingredients had been properly sealed and secured. The second the flood waters receded, she was back in her kitchen.\nEscoffier's goal was not simply to create a dessert that would surpass the Gateau Debord and present it to Furina — her ultimate aim was to demolish the boundaries of traditional cooking entirely.\nShe did not attempt to tackle this cultural inertia head-on. Instead, like blending colors on a palette, she gradually introduced new flavors, fostering quiet, subtle innovation and progress.\nOver time, she would create a world without shackles, where even the humblest dishes could grace the tables of fine dining establishments and the most lavish cuisine could shed its haughty airs.\nThe ultimate goal was to discover a new peak of gastronomic pleasure. Even if this peak couldn't be reached in a single lifetime, Escoffier was determined to ascend toward it.\nThis would be a never-ending journey in pursuit of flavor, unbound by time or place. Whenever a new idea formed or an unfamiliar ingredient was discovered, she would throw every ounce of her being into researching it.\nEscoffier understood well the challenge she faced. It almost seemed to be reflected in her eyes — that shining peak of ultimate flavor, destined to refract the endless brilliance of her inspiration, like the pristine white plumage of a snow-winged goose..."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4</color>\nExperienced chefs are used to dealing with multiple sets of ingredients at once. As the pioneer of precision gastronomy, Escoffier frequently found herself whirling through the kitchen like a spinning top.\nWhile other chefs might take established ingredients and season them to achieve a desired flavor, her approach was to construct a \"flavor protocol\" based on the underlying principles of each dish. This process requires precise dissection of ingredients, complex cooking modalities, refinement, distillation, and a host of techniques that could add literally dozens of steps to the cooking process.\nAs a result, Escoffier began to explore the limits of multitasking. While preparing to cook each dish, she would divide the tasks that needed to be performed and plan them out in order down to the second, just as though she were a musician performing a dress rehearsal.\nHer well-choreographed cooking was such that this process became known throughout the culinary world as the \"Kitchen Waltz.\"\nBut after training in this manner for some time, she suddenly came to her senses:\n\"I'm a chef, not a performer on the stage!\"\nFor Escoffier, it was vital that she spread the load by not only taking on extra help but also developing more convenient tools.\nAnd so, when she first started taking on \"custom orders,\" she sought out the help of a group of engineers from the Fontaine Research Institute. Based on her requirements, these mechanical experts together created the \"Experimental Multi-Purpose Gastromek Assembly,\" comprising her two capable assistants, the \"All-Spectrum Multi-Use Cooking Mek\" and the \"Self-Adapting Movement Signal Tracking Support Mek.\"\nThe All-Spectrum Multi-Use Cooking Mek functioned as a combined cooking and plating device, integrating ingredient measurement, temperature regulation, and moisture control functions into a mechanism designed to separate mineral components. In Escoffier's hands, it was a capable substitute for essentially any piece of kitchen hardware. It could even be used to create \"randomized cuisine\" by setting it to perform cooking steps at random.\nIn fact, she often made use of this feature to generate ingredient combinations she might never have conceived of on her own. At times, these culinary experiments bore delicious fruit — though just as often, they produced results that were barely edible.\nThe Self-Adapting Movement Signal Tracking Support Mek expanded the technical side of cooking by harnessing the power of \"prosthetics.\" It could be pre-programmed to perform a vast array of different movements that could then be executed following signals provided by Escoffier. Once installed upon her back, it was almost like a prehensile tail — whether manipulating utensils, handling ingredients, or carrying trays of food, it proved a steady and reliable assistant.\nIf anything, this tail-like mechanism was sometimes too responsive, reacting to even the slightest movement Escoffier made. On such occasions, the light meant to indicate its operating status would start flashing in sync with its malfunctions.\nHad she known it would do this, she would have asked the engineers not to include an indicator light at all — so as to prevent the mechanism from betraying her emotions..."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 6</color>\nCompared to the blazing heat of an open flame, Escoffier is far more fascinated with the frigid cold of ice.\nWhen it comes to man-made technology, the requirements for cooling something down are significantly more demanding than those for heating it up.\nLow temperatures are key to locking in the original flavor of ingredients. The importance of preserving the freshness of food — both in the time between being gathered and being cooked and between being cooked and being served — is impossible to overstate.\nTo these ends, Escoffier has tried everything to guarantee a stable supply of high-quality ice.\nThe effects of Mist Flowers' freezing vapors are impressive, but they have a limited range of effect, and their cooling properties are a tad weak. The costs of using alchemical solutions are so vast that even the Hotel Debord wouldn't countenance them. Even the mechanisms of the Fontaine Research Institute cannot maintain artificially low temperatures for any significant amount of time...\nEscoffier once even traveled to the Dragonspine region to seek out a legendary \"Arcane Cryo Source.\"\nWrapping herself in a thick coat and tightly wound scarf and carrying a heavy pack and an Iron Point, she wandered the mountain slopes for days.\nEven when her polearm had been worn beyond use, she still hadn't located her target. Suffering from severe frostbite and carrying wounds from repeated battles with the area's monsters, she had no choice but to leave empty-handed.\nOn the long road back, Escoffier heard rumors of a mysterious Cryo entity known as Daleth, which only served to deepen her sense of regret. Her desire to find this source of Cryo would become a goal exceeded in intensity only by her obsession to advance the culinary arts.\nOn another trip to Natlan in search of new ingredients, the stiflingly hot climate left her in some distress, causing her to take the wrong path and stumble into dangerous territory more than once.\nIt never rains but it pours — just as Escoffier finally located the ingredients she was looking for, she carelessly disturbed a group of Avatars of Lava. Surrounded and in mortal danger, the scorching heat of burning Phlogiston almost caused her to faint. And even as she beat a hasty retreat, she was sent flying by an exploding barrel of Phlogiston.\nUp until this point, she had been desperately clutching her traveling pack, doing her best to protect the cooking mechanisms and ingredients inside. One thought kept reverberating inside her mind...\nIce... Ice... Ice...\nHer memories beyond that point are hazy — as though she had inadvertently drunk a large quantity of spirits. All she could recall afterwards was that some... freezing current had washed over her from behind, flowing nonstop until the flames clinging to her clothes had been extinguished, and she had somehow left the monsters' territory behind.\nIt was only once she had returned to Fontaine with the rare ingredients she had gathered that she discovered the Vision hanging from her back, radiating a cold brilliance.\nThe residual shock of her near-death encounter was replaced with a sense of joyful astonishment. The euphoria that enveloped her utterly washed away the pain of her injuries.\nIn order to maintain a sense of cold clarity, Escoffier secured her vision to her hairband, hoping it would calm her mind in the heat of the moment and help her retain absolute physical coolness in a kitchen roasted by roaring flames.\nWith the help of her Vision, she finally managed to realize her dream of keeping her ingredients cool in all conditions. Not only that, but after learning to wield the elemental power it granted her, she combined it with the functions of her \"cooking mek\" to great effect, massively expanding the scope of her search for ingredients.\nEven her utensils benefitted — the knives, forks, and spoons she could now form from elemental ice were exceptionally durable, not to mention convenient to replace. Another advantage of Cryo-generated cutlery was that Escoffier no longer had to waste her time and energy carrying and washing silverware.\nAnd yet, despite being the most capable ice-wielding chef in all of Fontaine — perhaps even Teyvat — Escoffier produces surprisingly little ice cream.\nPerhaps one day she will devote her efforts to creating an entire school of cuisine based around it, crafting frozen treats that can be conjured up and enjoyed anywhere and anytime..."
