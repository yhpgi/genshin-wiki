Lanoire could not leave prison and go to her relatives since, according to the papers, she simply did not exist. Having made friends with Lanoire, Caterpillar decided to help the girl escape prison. The chosen method was the \"Game of the Rich\" - a game invented by the guard Estienne, in which teams competed to collect credit coupons, the special currency of the Fortress of Meropide. The winning team would be able to travel with Estienne to the surface for periodic checks. Thus, Lanoire could leave prison, and no one would look for her.\nTeaming up with Traveler and Paimon, Caterpillar, and Lanoire were able to defeat the other teams, mainly due to Caterpillar, who had been collecting coupons for years by teaming up with other prisoners. Although the Fortress of Meropide guard, Noailles, tried to interfere with the escape plan, Lanoire, and Caterpillar were still able to escape and go to Lanoire's grandfather, Earnshaw, with the help of Estienne.\nDuring his adventures with Lanoire, Caterpillar tells her a tale about a foolish apprentice, in whom he sees himself:"

        "text": "<color=#ffffffd9>\"- So you still remember that story.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- Of course. There's no way I would forget! I've been waiting for you to come back and finish telling me the whole thing! So, in the end, did the apprentice find the little fish?</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- Well, many, many years laterâ€¦ The foolish apprentice plucked up the courage to bid farewell to the great mage, left the workshop, and embarked on a journey to find the little fish. But he had never seen the vast ocean before, so he had no idea what the little fish's homeland was like. Therefore, he had to ask for directions along the way...</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>He asked the reeds by the river, and upon hearing his story, the reeds laughed so hard that they bent over at the waist. \"You are looking for the ocean,\" said the reeds. \"It is a place much wider and grander than any river, the destination where rivers flow into.\"</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>He followed the flowing river and eventually reached the vast ocean. However, the ocean was so vast that he didn't even know where to begin. So he asked the Violetgold Angler Gull resting on the pier. It was astonished by his story and dropped the fries it was holding in its beak in surprise. \"Buddy, this is an impossible task,\" the gull said. \"No one has ever, and I mean EVER, tried to find a common little fish in the vast ocean. Besides, who knows, it might have already...\" The apprentice silenced the seagull by stuffing its mouth with bread, disregarding it and its noisy companions. Then, he continued along the coastline, asking and searching as he went. Since he was a foolish apprentice, he only knew how to search in the most foolish way. He spent a lot of time learning how to dive, and again and again, he swam further and deeper into the oceanâ€¦</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- He must've found it in the end! If you wish hard enough and you don't give up, your wish will definitely come true! That's what Grandpa told me.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- You like stories with happy endings... Well, Grandpa Earnshaw is right. Despite being a foolish apprentice, he finally managed to find that little fish in the most foolish way. When he found it, the little fish was swimming freely in the water with its family amidst an ever-shifting school of fish. But the apprentice recognized it at first glance, even among countless others of its kind. \"Finally, I found you...\" The apprentice had fulfilled his wish, but his emotions were not as jubilant as he had imagined. Instead, he felt somewhat bewildered. The school of fish curiously surrounded him, urging him to explain the whole story. He clumsily explained everything, and finally, as if relieved of a burden, he released a long stream of bubbles into the water. \"I must apologize twice,\" the apprentice said. \"Once for not summoning the courage to help you when you sought my assistance in the past, and once for the abruptness of my visit here...\". \"After finally seeing you again, I realized how selfish I have been... I thought that if I could apologize to you in person, I could forgive my past self.\" \"What does it matter?\" The little fish's response surprised the apprentice. \"You see, in the past, you couldn't help me, but I have still returned to my homeland, back to the embrace of my family.\" \"I haven't been harmed, so you don't need to seek anyone's forgiveness.\" \"You have spent so much time and effort over such a trivial matter. I can't decide whether to call you upright or foolish. But even if you are foolish, we don't mind being friends with foolish humans...\"</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- Wah! So, does that mean they finally became friends? What happens then?</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- Then? Well, they became the very best friends.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- Huh? That's it? So, Cater, is that how the story ends...?</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- Mm-hmm, that's the end of my story. If a good story doesn't end in the right place, it will lose the fun. Heroes will become evil dragons. I've heard of stories that didn't want to end. And when they finally did, they were with but horrible endings and everyone in these stories had their hearts broken. Those were bad stories. But, dear Lanoire, the story of you and your adventure is still ongoing. Happy birthday. And one day, you'll have to share your story with me, won't you?</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>- Mm-hmm... I promise I will, Cater.\"</color>",
