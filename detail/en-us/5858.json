As one who must keep order, Chourei needs to mediate such conflicts, despite her desire to only lead a peaceful life. Thanks to some inspiration from the harbormaster, she started requesting that conflicting parties settle things over Genius Invokation TCG, with the losing party being bid not to make a fuss — a method that has seen impressive results. Slowly, Chourei became quite the hobbyist herself.\n<color=#ccbfad>Special Rule: You will not use your own deck, but a preset deck named \"Eruption of Energies Ravenous\" instead.</color>\n<color=#ffffffd9>Opposing Lineup</color>"
