Until the day that the fires turn me into ashes,\nYou shall see the glowing embers of this flower shining through the dark smoke.\"\nThe people followed the flower's flickering light to the edge of the Mare Jivari.\nThere they found the blooming flowers — but the Lavawalker was nowhere to be seen."

It sparked fear and jealousy among peers and seniors alike.\n\"How dare the Lavawalker challenge the flames of the Mare Jivari! Such blasphemy has not been seen in hundreds of years!\nThe flaming sea will surely devour this arrogant young man and the sky will blow his ashes into the void.\"\nIn his jealousy, the teacher demanded that his student step into the flaming sea wearing the circlet.\nIn a state of calmness, the Lavawalker strolled onto the lava and gradually disappeared into the horizon."

He crafted this hourglass to mark the passing of time.\nAs the flames blazed, burning sand flowed endlessly through the hourglass day after day.\nSadly, though the Lavawalker did not fear the scorching flames of the Mare Jivari, he could not quench the torturing flames of time.\nThe anguish of being left alone without the disciples and family he held so dear burned away at his soul more than any flames could ever scorch his flesh."
