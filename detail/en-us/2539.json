Who knows, perhaps they will bloom throughout the land.\nFlora: When I think about it like that, the storm doesn't seem so scary anymore, haha.\nII. Traveler: Tell me about your flowers.\nFlora: We carry a large variety of flowers. Are you looking for anything in particular?\nI. Traveler: Tell me about Dandelions.\nFlora: Dandelions are so feathery. They are my personal favorite.\nFlora: The Acting Grand Master of the Knights is also known as the Dandelion Knight, as I recall.\nFlora: She probably learned the power of Anemo from the dandelions, hehe.\nI. Traveler: Why do you like Dandelions so much?\nFlora: Hehe, I wonder... Maybe it's because I've been reading The Fox in the Dandelion Sea.\nFlora: Here, take it. Maybe you'll like dandelions too once you finish reading it, hehe.\nII. Traveler: Tell me about Sweet Flowers.\nFlora: Sweet Flowers, you say?\nFlora: They look nice, but most people just use them for cooking.\nFlora: If you see people having Sweet Flowers in their gardens...\nFlora: They are probably used to get sugar.\nIII. Traveler: Tell me about Cecilias.\nFlora: Cecilias! You've got good taste.\nFlora: They grow in cold and windy places. Legend has it they only bloom when it's quiet.\nFlora: If you wish to cultivate them...\nFlora: You'll probably have better luck with Mist Flowers.\nIII. Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.\nFlora: You need to go?\nFlora: I'll tell you more about flowers next time if you like."
