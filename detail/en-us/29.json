Red ropes still adorn her arms, but the bitter cold in Shenhe's heart has faded.\n\"All children love toys.\" This was the conclusion Shenhe came to after observing Granny Shan's toy store.\nKites, Xiao Lanterns, and window decorations made from cut colored paper... Children in Liyue could not help but stare fixedly at them as they passed.\nAnd should the adults beside them cotton on to their desire and buy that toy for them, those children would smile.\nShenhe possessed no such childhood memories of the sort, so she could not understand their feelings in that moment from experience. But seeing how their eyes sparkled, she believed that these toys must be related to some wondrous emotion.\nThough she had not figured out just what this emotion might be, this beautiful possibility did soften her heart a little.\n\"Shenhe seems very interested in toys.\" This was the conclusion Xianyun came to from observing Shenhe gazing at the toy store as if in a daze.\nHer disciple, she knew, had lost her family when young, and had trained under her wing ever since, and thus opportunities to access toys had been few and far between.\nNow that Shenhe had returned to live amongst humans, and she herself had taken their form to do so, she found as she grew more accustomed to the lives of mortals that Shenhe had indeed lacked many opportunities for joy compared to human children.\nAnd was it not her responsibility as master and elder, she thought, to accompany her disciple for a jaunt at the toy store?\n\"Master seems very fond of toys,\" Shenhe reflected as she and her master Xianyun, at the latter's insistence, spoke to Granny Shan for the sixth time.\nIn truth, she did not quite understand the charm of these little window decorations or firecrackers.\nHer master would often use sigils to create various colorful birds to decorate her abode. They were more vivid and lifelike than these decorations, and lovelier by far. And as for the crackling and popping of the firecrackers, they were quite crude compared to the adeptal melodies she was used to.\nIn truth, the toys themselves had but limited appeal to her, for what she actually liked was the smiles on the children's faces as they looked upon them.\nBut her master seemed very interested indeed, asking about all manner of details regarding the toys, from the crafting methods to the tricks behind releasing firecrackers. Finally, her master asked her what sort of toys she liked.\nShe believed that her master's interest must have some meaning behind it, and so she answered honestly. Then, she looked upon her master's calm, thoughtful, but silent face.\n\"Shenhe does not, in fact, like toys,\" Xianyun realized at last, after several visits to the toy stores.\nIf not, that gentle expression she saw on Shenhe's face as she stood in front of the toy store should have appeared at least once as she spoke with Granny Shan at length about the little imperfections in the latter's use of paper in window decorations, about improvements to firecracker casings to improve child safety, to the point she had completely earned the old lady's admiration.\nWhat her disciple needed was perhaps not toys themselves.\nA human's childhood and youth pass by in but the blink of an eye, and those who pass on shall never return. What, then, should she do as an elder?\nLantern Rite was fast approaching, and human custom dictated that festivals were a good opportunity to accept gifts. After all, had she not accepted just such from the Qixing in years prior...?\nA gift... Yes, that might do.\nShenhe did not realize her master's intent until she and Ganyu had received their Lantern Rite gifts from her.\nShe had felt no sense of regret about standing in front of the toy store, but her master's kindness was surprising all the same.\nIt was at that moment, when she took the long dress from the gift box her master handed to her and caressed its smooth hem that she understood how those children felt upon seeing those toys.\nBoth she and her master had changed much upon coming to the mortal realm — perhaps the future held still more pleasant surprises of this sort.\nHer future would be full of opportunities to make up for all the laughter lost and joy she had missed out on in the past. She would keep all the warmth she received in her heart, to melt the ice within her bones."

But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.\nFor example, she almost never considers \"negotiation\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \"threats\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?\nShe has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.\nFor example: Why do we need to pay for food?\nIs there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?\nShe even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.\nIn a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.\nMuch like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.\nMountain Shaper once had this to say about her:\n\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\"\n\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\"\n\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\""

If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.\nWhen she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.\nOver time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.\nHe left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.\nAt last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.\nHer father had brought with him a secret art known as \"Fate Transference\"—\nBy making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.\nAt that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.\nHe claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...\nBut the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.\nHer father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \"seelie\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.\nStupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.\nCrises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.\nThis creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!\nGripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \"seelie,\" trembling yet resolute...\nSeveral days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.\nTaking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.\nIf not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today."

On impulse, she came down from the mountains one night to return to what was once her home.\nShe did not know how she felt about her home or her family. She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:\nTo live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.\nShe learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.\nHer childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.\nShe did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.\nShe simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.\nWas it hatred? Mania? Relief?\nThey were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.\nNo, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.\nShe stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.\nEach step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back."

The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.\nIt was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.\nCloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.\nThe adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.\nShenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.\nOn the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.\nWhen the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.\n...\nToday, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.\nThrough her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:\nThe first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret."

Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...\nAs the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.\nWith the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.\nThe vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.\nIn the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate.
