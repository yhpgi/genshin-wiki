As she drew close, she was enveloped by powerful energies, and she saw her own image within the portal as one looking into a mirror, feeling as if she were in two places at once.\nWith a flash of light, the \"world\" that Aloy knew completely disappeared from her sight, and she now found herself in a strange, beautiful new world just waiting to be explored."
