It allows its bearer to control one of the elements of Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, Anemo, Geo, Electro, and Dendro. A Vision can materialize a person's elemental power. For example, Oz was created when Fischl received her Vision. The seven elemental types are connected to the Seven Sovereigns — elemental dragons and true rulers of Teyvat.\nWhen the First usurper defeated the dragons, they stole the dragon's authority. Later, the usurper was wounded in the Great War of Vengeance and could no longer use their absolute authority to suppress the original order of this world because their functions were ruined. They, along with the one who came after, created the Gnoses, one for each of the seven divine thrones. The stolen power became the basis of the Archons' authority, and the Visions that people receive are part of this authority. Whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift (Vision). Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person."

No one knows exactly about the process of obtaining the Vision: for many, it simply appears out of thin air, while others have revived the faded Vision, which had lost its owner. Thus, Kazuha was able to ignite the extinguished Vision of his late friend for a moment, when their desires coincided. Contrary to popular belief among people, the Archons do not give out Visions, but their receipt may be associated with the will of a person and the Archon's authority. Thus, after the Vision Hunt Decree in Inazuma, not a single Electro Vision was obtained. When the Dragon Sovereign Neuvillette fully restored his authority and set aside parts of himself, as like the dragon-treasure hoards of old, he left them awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them. The first one to receive a Vision during Neuvillette's reign was Furina."

That is why losing a Vision without an owner's will can lead to devastation, apathy, and amnesia. Visions have a strong connection with their owner, so for unknown reasons, the Traveler could see what was happening to Tartaglia when they were in possession of Tartaglia's Vision.\nSome people think that Visions stole pride originally due to them. Thus, Keqing left her Vision in a huge fire for three days and three nights, ran over it with a minecart full of rocks, and even hurled it from the heights of the Jade Chamber. She has never been successful. Although a Vision cannot be lost or destroyed, the owner can voluntarily give up their goals and their Vision. These people will not suffer the usual consequences. Such was the case when Diluc gave up his Vision, leaving Mondstadt after his father's death, but three years later he took it back. Itto, having lost a duel to Kujou Sara, also voluntarily gave up his Vision as a sign of defeat.\nAllogenes have different opinions on their Visions. Some people see them as an insult from the gods, and some use them to help people or on their job. Some don't care about their Visions, and others see Visions as God's approval of their actions, unlike the people without a Vision, who often feel that they are abandoned and forgotten by the Gods and that their actions go unnoticed.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
