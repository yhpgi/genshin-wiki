It shall be an amnesiac world, lost to itself.\"\nIn the heart of eternity, those old friends still appear so clear and the scent of the sakura remains so fresh.\nBut I will never forget you, just as I will not forget the things that were lost across the years.\nAfter all...\nHaving witnessed the pitch-dark annihilation consume those precious to her,\nHow could she not see the absurd nature of life and death, yes, incomprehensible destiny itself, as her mortal foe?\nBut since no one can overturn the impermanence of the world, and the barren nature of this game,\nThen let the eternal euthymia within her heart carry forth into the nation she loves."

At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.<br/>This is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changed over many years to \"Torachiyo.\"<br/>But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.<br/>Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional.",
