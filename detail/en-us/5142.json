        "text": "One day, the magician's assistant, Lynette, found a cat in the Court of Fontaine and named it Bonnie. She tried to find Bonnie's owners by placing an ad in The Steambird, and a man and a woman answered her ad. After examining the cat, the man decided that he had made a mistake, and the woman said that the cat belonged to her friend. Lynette suspected that the woman might be a Garde, so she revealed her name, Elodie. Elodie was investigating a case of smuggling across the border, and the real owner of the cat was one of her main suspects. When he realized that the Gardes were looking for him, he ran away and was separated from Bonnie. Elodie hoped that the owner might return for the cat, so she answered the ad in the newspaper.\nElodie revealed that Bonnie's owner was Pierre Lefevere, a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute. The Lefevere family was once a famous aristocratic family involved in many crimes. One of the family members \"bought\" Lynette many years ago, before she joined Fatui and the House of the Hearth. In recent years, almost all the family members, including the head, were killed by an unknown assassin. Most of the remaining members died of hunger and disease, and the survivors changed their names. Pierre hid in the institute under a different name, but when the Gardes searched his belongings, they found a pendant of an illegitimate member of the Lefevere family.\nThe contraband that Pierre was transporting was a new type of drug called the Imitation Sinthe. When the Gardes confiscated all Sinthe and arrested the head of the Confrerie of Cabriere, Marcel, who was behind the production of Sinthe, people began to look for a new way to get drugs. Due to the measures taken after the Sinthe incident, criminals became smarter and managed to transfer their sales abroad. When the Marechausse Phantom began an investigation to track down all the people in Fontaine who were capable of producing such a drug, they came across Pierre. Elodie knew that if she took Bonnie to the Gardes, Pierre would definitely not come for it, so she asked Lynette and the Traveler to keep an eye on the cat.\nLynette felt that something was wrong with Pierre's story, so she went to the Fontaine Research Institute to find the truth. There, she met her brother Lyney and the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse. As Lynette suspected, her brother, who had been acting suspiciously in recent days, was investigating Pierre Lefevere. Chevreuse and Lyney revealed that Pierre had become addicted to Sinthe, so he tried to use the Institute's resources to create a substance with a similar effect. Although Pierre claimed he had done this only for research purposes, the Institute denied him access to the relevant materials. He was placed on leave until the investigation was completed, but due to staff shortages, the investigation was postponed.\nSince the Imitation Sinthe left clear traces at the production sites, Lynette, Chevreuse, Lyney, and the Traveler investigated a suspicious place on the coast near the Thalatta Submarine Canyon. From the evidence they collected, they concluded that Pierre was using floating barrels to transfer drugs and had an accomplice. If Pierre was only responsible for producing the Imitation Sinthe, the second person would have to be responsible for transporting the goods across the border. Lynette and the Traveler went to the Lumidouce Harbor to examine the registration logs and look for clues.\nOnce at the harbor, Lynette and the Traveler discovered that the gendarme Elodie was in charge of protecting Lumidouce Harbor. In the registration logs, they found records of a \"Humane Society\" that rehomed animals abroad. The head of the organization was Bernard, the man who responded to the ad about Bonnie. Lynette and the Traveler figured out that the Humane Society was using cats to transport the Imitation Sinthe so that no one could detect it. Pierre fed the drugs to the cats in special corrosion-resistant bags and transported them in floating barrels with holes for air. When Bernard examined Bonnie, he felt her stomach to make sure she did not have the Imitation Sinthe.\nWhen Lynette, the Traveler, and Elodie arrived at the Humane Society in the Court of Fontaine, they captured Bernard. He admitted that the organization was in a sorry state, but one day he received an unexpected letter. He was offered a large sum of money to transport animals abroad, and he accepted. Although Bernard constantly communicated with Pierre by letter, he never met him in person. When the Marechaussee Phantom began investigating, Bernard received a final letter stating that Pierre had gone on the run."

Since Pierre was so careful and secretive, it was suspicious that he carried a pendant with him that linked him to the Lefevere family. The Institute had cut off Pierre's access to the materials, but he somehow continued to make the Imitation Sinthe. The letter that Bernard had received also seemed strange: if Pierre had known that Bonnie did not have the drug, he could have warned Bernard about it. And if the cat had them, she would have been the main evidence that had to be disposed of. Having collected all the evidence, Lynette and the Traveler came to the conclusion that there was a third person in the case, unknown to both Pierre and Bernard. And this third person had long ago decided to sacrifice them for the sake of their own salvation in the case."

She was the one who had led the investigation to the \"Humane Society\" by noticing their name in the registration logs. Elodie had organized the records of the society's activities when filling out the logs in such a way that anyone reading them would immediately notice, and the logs themselves did not contain information about the port administration's activities during the shifts that Elodie worked. In addition, she often changed shifts, and they coincided exactly with the activities of the \"Humane Society.\"\nElodie's real name was Elodie Lefevere, and she was the illegitimate daughter of the family. She became a Garde before the fall of the Lefeveres, and actively participated in the interrogations and arrests of family members in order to avoid suspicion. Thanks to the help of Chevreuse and Lyney, who arrived in time, Elodie was caught and taken into custody.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

She wrote scripts herself, performed on stage, and mentored each of them. Dulphy was born with an incurable illness, and once her family found out it couldn't be treated, they abandoned her. For several years, she agreed to any job, tried to manage her illness with various medicines, and during a severe flare-up, she lay in an alleyway for days at a time. When Aurelie found Dulphy, she said that she had a beautiful voice and offered to teach her to sing. The director taught her to sing and perform, helped her find money for medicine, and took care of her. Another actor, Lauwick, was the son of a murderer and grew up in an orphanage. Other children bullied and beat him, and one day he ran away. When he had already lost all faith in humanity, he met Aurelie. The actor Pauleau was in love with Aurelie. One day, he confessed his feelings to her, but she said that the whole troupe was like siblings to her. Pauleau replied that he would always help the troupe and her and hoped that in the future she would be able to rethink what she wanted in her life."

Vilmant, playing the main villain, took Aurelie's death very hard and did not appear in the city. It was he who caused the death of the leader. Since the troupe stayed afloat thanks to donations from the audience, their financial situation was difficult.

He immediately explained everything to the leader, and she told the merchant that the troupe could not agree to this collaboration. In a rage, the merchant threatened to sue for damages, but Aurelie promised to solve the problem herself. Suddenly, she ordered everyone to leave the city and never returned."

        "text": "More than ten years ago, a phantom thief, known as \"The Weasel,\" became active in the Court of Fontaine. Nobody knew his true identity, and the authorities never managed to catch him. He had a bad reputation: he targeted whatever people held dear, and no one was safe from his predation. He would just as soon steal a necklace from a rich merchant's safe as he would a toy doll given to a commoner child for their birthday. If not for an accident, The Weasel could have continued to roam free, but ten years ago, a magician named Cesar fell to his death in a botched high-altitude escape performance. When the police went through his personal effects, they found a hoard of stolen loot and gadgets used for criminal activities, and that was how The Phantom Weasel's identity was revealed to all. Many did not believe that Cesar could be a criminal, because he was constantly giving gifts to children. Sometimes he would ask them to write down what they wanted on paper, and during the next performance, he would pull the gifts out of thin air. But after his death, a rumor spread that Cesar had asked children to write their wishes on paper so that he could steal their most precious possessions. After Cesar's death, there were fewer thefts in the city, and people began to forget about him, until one day, ten years later, The Weasel wrote a warning letter and hung it right on the gates of the opera house: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Three days from now, when evening falls, I shall take from you that which you hold most dear at the opera house, just as you did to me ten years ago.\"</color>\nThree days later, the magician Lyney was scheduled to perform at the Opera Epiclese in the evening, so he wanted to expose The Weasel so that his concert would not be canceled. He asked the Traveler and Paimon to join the investigation and temporarily act as his assistants. The first step was to find out who Cesar really was, because if he truly was The Phantom Weasel, the real Weasel would be dead, and the warning letter was just a copycat criminal. And if he was not The Weasel, the real Weasel would be alive and have gone into hiding ten years ago. They decided to start with Cesar's fiancée, Jemma, who visits his grave every week. She often spoke into the void and told him the latest news. People thought that Cesar did not deserve the love of such a woman, because he was a criminal. When Jemma appeared at the cemetery, she was wounded and looked scared, so she refused to answer Lyney's questions. Even though they left her alone, it felt like she was hiding something.\nThe next day, they decided to meet Cesar's student Lorenzo, who had inherited his secrets of magic and craft. Before long, Lorenzo was the next big magician in town, his fame surpassing even that of his master, and it made him very wealthy. He's since left the magic scene and became a wealthy businessman with his fingers in a lot of different pies. He claimed that the real Weasel had died, and it was the imitator who left the letter. <color=#ffffffd9>\"Look, you of all people should know that a magician never reveals their secrets — and in any case, dead men don't talk. So if you really care about your magician's pride, then you'll forget about Cesar and move on.\"</color> The conversation with Lorenzo also did not give answers, but left the feeling that he was hiding something. Leaving Lorenzo, Lyney noticed surveillance. These people threatened Jemma and wanted to deal with Lyney and the Traveler, but were defeated. Lyney assured Jemma that she was not in danger, and she told him about Cesar's workshop in the Fleuve Cendre."

The children turned out to be incredibly talented and had unusual thoughts, so the magician was sure that over time, they would surpass him. Cesar even wanted to take them on tour, but they refused, and one day he overheard them talking about \"Father\" and the \"mission.\" As they parted, he shared with them his view of the world: <color=#ffffffd9>\"It's full of lies and falsehoods, and that is why we must find our own truth.\"</color>"

At this point, a dummy will fall out of the box, but it looks real enough to grab the audience's attention, and they start wailing and screaming. Meanwhile, the real magician, who has by now blended into the crowd, waits for a good moment to make their appearance and puts on a hysterical performance: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Oh no! Is that me!? Did I just fall to my death!?\"</color> The audience's gaze then turns to the magician, and by the time they realize what's happened, the dummy has vanished — as if everything that just happened was some sort of shared illusion. Cesar himself invented this trick but was never able to perform it. When the box opened, it was not the dummy that fell out, but the magician himself. The box was hanging under the highest point of the opera house, and Cesar fell down from there. Since he was an ordinary man without a Vision, he could not hope to survive that fall."

From where they're standing, they have a clear view of the front, sides, and bottom, but the back and the top are no longer visible. At this point, the magician presses a button inside the box, opening a secret door out of view. For the trick to succeed, the magician must constantly keep the audience in suspense. Many days and nights of careful research and painstaking practice would have gone into this, all culminating in a performance just a few minutes long, but one that still manages to transform the shock and grief of a tragic accident into the joy and laughter of a mesmerizing magic trick."

The essence of magic is getting people to believe a lie. If even the truth raises eyebrows, the falsehoods become all the more difficult to mask. Cesar had to pretend to be right-handed so that the audience did not notice anything. But in his most stressful and nerve-wracking moments, and when no one was watching, a reflex would kick in, and he'd use his left hand, so he placed the button in the box on the left."

He spent a few extra seconds searching, and then the bottom of the box automatically opened.\nOnly a person close to Cesar had access to the props and knew which hand was Cesar's dominant, as close as his student Lorenzo was. It was his people who threatened Jemma and Lyney. He admitted that he hated Cesar because he forbade him from using tricks to get rich, while he poured everything into his street performances. Every other apprentice was living it up at their master's expense, but Lorenzo lived in poverty. He was afraid to leave since one word from Cesar could ruin his life, so he decided to kill his mentor. Lorenzo also admitted that he was The Weasel, but Lyney did not believe him."

It was established to honor the legendary Lochknights who searched for the Oceanids and welcomed the first Hydro Archon Egeria. Similar to other prominent festivals like Mondstadt's Windblume Festival and Liyue's Lantern Rite, it holds deep connections to the founding of Fontaine, making it one of the nation's most important festivals. Originally, people commemorated the Lochknights by imitating them, wearing special costumes, raising golden cups, and going door-to-door requesting pure water. However, Furina made the tradition more festive a few years ago by changing the water request to sweets. The festival is considered to be more carnival-like now and is popular among children who engage in \"trial or treat\" activities each year which include going door-to-door asking for candies with baskets during the celebration. During the first Fontinalia Festival, the Traveler and Paimon attended, and the prestigious \"Furina Award,\" named after the former Hydro Archon Lady Furina, was given out at the end of the festival. Despite the changes in leadership, the name is still fitting for the award as Furina remains a beloved figure in Fontaine.\nOne day, Lepine-Pauline, a specialist in Graph Adversarial Technology, decided to use an improved Kamera lens to rid Teyvat of everyone out there who's trying to con innocent people. She read in The Steambird that <color=#ffffffd9>\"Several keen-eyed thieves who noticed a flaw in the Gardemeks detection systems disguised themselves as Blubberbeasts during the commission of their crimes.\"</color> Completely blind to the would-be-Blubberbeasts, the Gardemeks made no attempt to intervene in the thefts committed by the gang. She had an idea that it was possible to improve the Gardemeks' ability to recognize targets in order to recognize criminals in disguise. Lepine-Pauline decided to collect sample images and, based on them, develop a simple but powerful and highly accurate image recognition algorithm that runs on a small graphical processing module. Any clockwork meka installed with this module would instantly be able to recognize people wearing disguises and accurately assess the criminal threat they pose. She hoped that her invention would make her incredibly rich and even borrowed a large sum from the bank to develop her technology.\nIt turned out that the news in The Steambird was a short story mailed to them by an anonymous amateur author, written in the style of a true story. Although the editors of the newspaper were afraid that the story could mislead readers, the Maison Gardiennage supported them in printing it. They figured that the false intel would be a great way to dupe potential criminals into wearing ridiculous costumes when breaking the law. Since the publication of this story, the Maison Gardiennage has made a slew of arrests including \"Phantom Blubberbeast,\" a \"Titanic Redcrown Finch,\" and a \"Specterman\" as the recognition function of the Gardemeks worked perfectly. Lepine-Pauline was ready to fight the Gardemeks to be sent to the Fortress of Meropide in order not to pay off the loan, but the newspaper's journalist Charlotte, whom the researcher asked to advertise her technology, offered her an alternative use for the device. The \"Kamera Lens for Image Recognition Sample Collection\" was specially designed for high-fidelity image capture and analysis. The rapid focal length adjustment could be a very useful function in its own right. It would make journalists' jobs much easier and had the potential to revolutionize Fontaine's news media. Thus, Lepine-Pauline regained her hope of becoming rich, and Charlotte got news material: <color=#ffffffd9>\"The boundaries between real news reports and news-like fiction must not be blurred, even when there's a compelling justification for doing so.\"</color>"

Next to the Gallery is the building where the rival of the famous fashion designer, Chiori, lives. When he falsely accused Chiori of collaborating with criminals, she called the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse, to prevent Chiori from overdoing it in the \"conversation.\" The Beaumont Workshop, owned by Estelle, is also located there. The workshop offers a full, comprehensive service for individual orders. To order, prepayment, documentation with requirements, and supporting documents are required. Forging in the workshop is carried out by a special machine running on Indemnitium. Previously, during trials, the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale collected people's faith in justice and converted it into energy, which was then used throughout Fontaine. In addition to Indemnitium, Fontaine has Pneumousia energy, which is produced independently of the Archon's power but is unstable in nature. When Fontaine's prophecy had not yet come true, Estelle helped the Fatui make Magic Pockets in which people could put all their things in case of danger. At the time, Estelle owed money to Confrerie of Cabriere. She promised to repay her debt by the end of the month, but the people from Confrerie of Cabriere wanted to get seventy percent at that moment. It turned out that Confrerie of Cabriere owed money to the Northland Bank. The Fatui Harbinger Childe went to collect their debt and stopped to talk to the Traveler returning from visiting Estelle.\nWhen Furina left her role as Archon, she quickly left her residence and went to live in a small apartment. Although she had gained her freedom and fulfilled her duty, she did not know where to go next. The concept of \"freedom\" rang hollow. Furina's luggage remained piled up in her new rental apartment, and she lacked all will even to tidy up or get moved in. All she could do was lie in bed and stare at the bare ceiling. One day, Clorinde the Champion Duelist, who had previously been under her command, visited her. The duelist was shocked at Furina's living conditions, quickly expressing her willingness to pay for better accommodations, a notion Furina expended no small amount of effort disabusing her of. Despite this, she was dragged, however reluctantly, into at least properly unpacking and tidying up the room, and now Furina lives in the Vasari Passage."

After she became an ordinary person, she never wanted to go on stage again, but after learning about the history of the troupe, she decided to become an artistic consultant for the last time in the play \"The Little Oceanid.\" The main actress, suffering from illness, was unable to appear in the final scene of the play, so Furina had to replace her. After a wonderful performance and communication with the troupe, Furina decided that perhaps she would return to the world of theater.\nOne day, the Chief Editor of The Steambird, Euphrasie, told the Traveler about an order that had been kept in the editorial office for six months. In the order, an elderly man, Benoit Leroy, asked to find assistants. When Traveler and Paimon volunteered for the task, they saw Benoit looking depressed and scared next to his daughter, Morticia's, husband. After investigating and talking with Morticia and her husband, it turned out that Morticia's real name was Autumn, and Benoit was her adoptive father, who sold her as a wife to a rich man for the sake of inheritance. When Autumn's first husband died, Benoit received that house in the Vasari Passage and gave his daughter to her second husband, with whom she had a daughter. Later, Autumn killed her husband, for which she was sent to the Fortress of Meropide, and her daughter remained with Benoit. He gave the girl up for adoption without saying a word to Autumn. Autumn and her \"husband,\" Athos, escaped from prison to take revenge on Benoit and find the girl, but even after learning the truth, Autumn did not dare to invade the happy life of her daughter. Molli was adopted by a caring and rich family who tried to protect her from Benoit."

The signature on the relevant documentation is but a false identity — the real power lies with someone else. If one could hear the children whisper at night behind the Hotel's closed gates, one would hear this appellation: \"Father.\" When speaking of \"Father,\" some faces turn worshipful, some hearts are seized with fear, and still others look inscrutable, torn — but their tone always becomes one of respect. These children are part of the organization known as the House of the Hearth. They belong to the Fatui. This place is home to orphans the world over, and the luxurious Hotel is but one of the House's faces. As for this \"Father,\" the master of the House, she is none other than The Knave, Arlecchino, presently Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers. The Fatui — and this Harbinger — enjoy a mixed reputation. But to most of these children, \"Father\" is the most important figure in their lives. <color=#ffffffd9>\"It is only because 'Father' is here that this place is truly like a 'home.'\"</color> All children consider each other brothers and sisters and often hold family barbecues."

The Tsaritsa personally bestowed a new name on Peruere and entrusted her with being the first to use the Hydro Gnosis of Fontaine. Rules in the new House of the Hearth are quite strict, but not ruthless. The house became a common shelter for the children, which they had to support through joint efforts. Now, everyone was free to choose their own way of completing tasks, and even if they failed, they were not subjected to the same painful punishments. If they broke the rules or wanted to leave, they were given a bottled flame, a solution of fire in Arlecchino's blood, which destroyed all the person's memories of the House of the Hearth.\nThe House of the Hearth uses many codewords to maintain operational security and secrecy, and of these, \"Marelle\" was personally selected by The Knave herself. \"Marelle\" takes its meaning from a popular Fontainian children's game. Boxes sequentially marked with numbers are drawn out on the ground, a sandbag is thrown into one of the boxes, and the player will jump from box to box in a specific order. No one knows when this game began to spread, nor who created the rules, but all young children of the Hearth have experienced being taken by older children to play the game. The memories married to \"Marelle\" were always wonderful, like the kiss of radiant sunshine. As such, at first, the children were perplexed when their \"Father\" was torn between assigning \"At Ease\" or \"Danger\" to that codeword. Little did they know that in the House that came before, Marelle was no game. In those days, each and every child would leap into the boxes one by one under the vigilant eyes of the adults. Stepping out of the lines or breaking the rhythm was not allowed. There was never a need to ask for the punishment for making a bad jump, for the area outside of the boxes was lined with upturned blades. Those who lost their balance, whose stamina failed, or simply made an error out of fear, so many fell beyond the bounds, and the dark-red soil mourned that painful past. None would have associated it with being \"at ease\" — indeed, few could speak of it without blanching. Yet, after her hesitation, Arlecchino chose \"at ease\" as the codeword's meaning that day. Marelle was by then no longer associated with \"danger.\" Now, all that came to mind when this game was mentioned were smiling faces. In which case, she thought, let those unhappy memories dwell in her heart alone. Let the blood and dust be wiped away, for children to see a broader future.\nFamous magicians, Lyney and Lynette, grew up in the House of the Hearth. When they were still living on the street and performing magic tricks to earn a living, one aristocrat from the public decided to adopt them. At first, the children thought that the hard days of wandering were behind them, but the aristocrat needed a pocket magician, not a son. He took Lyney to banquets and parties to garner attention, which he would then use to expand his social circles. After another performance at the banquet, Lyney discovered that Lynette had not returned with him. It turned out that one \"eminent person\" liked her at the banquet, and the aristocrat presented her to him as a gift. Lyney ferreted out the location of the mansion of that so-called \"eminent person\" and went there that night. When he went inside, he saw only the floor stained with blood and the silhouette of Arlecchino in the dark. Lynette and several other girls were rescued. The Harbinger saw something in Lyney and invited him and his sister to the House of the Hearth: <color=#ffffffd9>\"The House of the Hearth welcomes you, for your interests align with ours. Here, none will ever betray you. Indeed, betrayal shall never be permitted here.\"</color> At first, Lyney did not trust Arlecchino, but she dealt with the aristocrat who adopted them, giving them freedom. Over the course of several years, Arlecchino killed all members of the family who bought Lynette."

Only the influence of \"Father\" and her control over the inner workings of the Court of Fontaine prevent any serious incidents from occurring. There was once an official funded by Lyney who served in the Maison Gardiennage. This person provided both intel in support of the Hotel's operations and scrubbed clean the effects of some of the Hotel's clandestine actions. These were actions that came with no small risk, but the official always performed them well, for he believed that the Fontaine of the present day needed someone like \"Father\" who could bypass the many layers of laws and regulations and take direct action. The official's deeds were eventually discovered, and on the brink of capture, he used an emergency communication device to send a message to Lyney. Upon discovering the device, the Gardes who arrived at the scene mocked the official's naivete, claiming that the signal sent merely informed his compatriots to save themselves — no one would be stupid enough to try to save him. The official's reply was also quite simple — even such an ending would have been fine for him, for he did not believe that his prior cooperation was the wrong decision. He still believed that he did the right thing by starting to cooperate with them. As the Gardes were taking him away, he was suddenly rescued by Lyney and Freminet, making the Gardes think that he had flown away in a flying machine.\nDespite the formidability of the Harbinger, she cares for her children and accepts their peculiarities. One day, a girl broke the rules and wore jewelry on a mission. When the girl later realized that she had made a mistake, she took off the necklace and fearfully waited for Arlecchino's reaction, trembling with fear. But she took the necklace and put it around the girl's neck, and then tied her hair with a velvet ribbon and put earrings with precious stones in her ears."

That year, the debt that his family owed finally reached the point where they would no longer be able to repay it.

In the end, she had no choice but to entrust Freminet to \"that orphanage\" — somewhere they could never get at him — and then face them alone.

        "text": "For a long time, the House of the Hearth tried to resist Fontaine's prophecy about the dissolution of people. All the orphans were Fontainians and would do anything to save their homeland. So, the children of the House of the Hearth distributed Magic Pockets to the Fontainians, in which they could place personal belongings in case of a sudden threat. In addition, Arlecchino conducted an investigation about the Gnosis: she had long suspected that Lady Furina did not have it, so she sent the children to the Opera Epiclese and to the Fortress of Meropide to find out the truth. During the fulfillment of the prophecy, Arlecchino and the other Fatui took a direct part in evacuating, helping residents, and rebuilding damaged areas.\nOn the Hotel Bouffes d'ete's Founding Day, all the children were abustle, draping festive colors all over the place. To the residents, outside festivals and events were cold and emotionless things, foreign elements in their lives, and only this dwelling could bring them true warmth. The children were preparing for the holiday with all their might: Lynette, along with other children, pulled ribbons and hung up handwritten congratulatory posters, Freminet monitored the serviceability of the magic props, and Lyney was preparing a secret magic trick. And thus, the banquet was successfully held with everyone's support. The children danced to the joyous music playing from the grand hall's phonograph and enjoyed delicious food — this was the birthday of no one in particular, but this was the day they all felt they had gained new lives. The final act was a magic performance: a magic box was placed in the center of the room, and when all the candles went out, Lyney announced that the most important present in their lives would appear from there. Under the explosions of firecrackers, the box opened, and Arlecchino appeared before them. Everyone froze, but \"Father\" was not going to reprimand anyone. On the contrary, in her opinion, Lyney deserved praise for keeping the secret well and being able to achieve the desired effect from the trick. That night, the children and their \"Father\" delighted in the various desserts together, and she personally sliced a serving of cake for each of them, which she herself enjoyed some of as well. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Lyney's Founding Day magic show was its ability to have even \"Father\" lay down her heavy burden and enjoy a brief moment of familial love.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

She is not employed by the Confrerie of Cabriere, nor does she work with any fixed brand. Nevertheless, she remains the most famous perfume designer in Fontaine, and the elegant, fashionable ladies of Fontaine would even give a precious gem for her perfume. The cost of one bottle of perfume can reach 570,000 Mora. Chiori, the owner of the Chioriya Boutique, entered into an agreement with her, according to which Emilie supplies small quantities of perfume to the Chioriya Boutique. The worker then secretly sprays them in the fitting room, and Chiori informs Emilie about the customer reviews.\nEmilie has expert knowledge in the field of chemistry and often assists the Maison Gardiennage in analyzing evidence and tracking down a killer. She helps them discover information that no one else can see, like what type of perfume a suspect wore or what type of flowers they sent as a gift. She can even determine the places they've been, right down to the very dirt they've stepped in. She once helped the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol catch a criminal who committed murders based on the book \"The Two Musketeers.\" The killer left rainbow roses near the victims, and Emilie was able to figure out that they belonged to a rare variety of flowers and tracked the nursery down to the house.\nDespite the popularity of Emilie's perfumes, perfume-making is just a hobby for her, something she does in her spare time, just like how some people learn to play a musical instrument or make crafts. Her real profession is a forensic cleaner. Her mother is a forensic pathologist, and since she was little, Emilie knew that she wanted to work in the field of criminal investigations, just like her mother. For a long time, her talent for chemistry inspired her to pursue trace evidence analysis. As she progressed further in her studies, she began to encounter real-life crime scenes. One day, she saw a child's murder scene and could not imagine how the child's parents would clean up the crime scene. So, she decided to become a forensic cleaner and use her chemicals to clean crime scenes.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The symbol of The Steambird is the mechanical pelican Sir Arthur, whose voice module stores the latest news from the Court of Fontaine. One day, Sir Arthur was kidnapped, and the Marechaussee Phantom worker, Talochard the Melusine, volunteered to solve the case, along with the intelligent lie detector \"Curve.\" It turned out that the editor of the newspaper, Jenck, was involved in the kidnapping. He learned how 30 years ago, the newspaper wrongly accused the creator of Curve of falsifying research results, which led to the death of the researcher in a judicial duel. Jenck contacted one of Fatui's agents in the Fleuve Cendre and made a deal with one of the Harbingers: in exchange for documents from the researcher's secret laboratory, they promised him the position of editor-in-chief of the newspaper. In the laboratory, he tried to kill the Melusine, Curve, the Traveler, and Paimon, for which he was punished by the Harbinger, who did not want to be in enmity with the Traveler. Jenck's tongue was torn out, and a note of apology was placed in its place."

Her contributions to a column about constellations in The Steambird have become her most stable income source, but she immediately shells out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more. Mona had the opportunity to work for newspapers by pure chance. When the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard the story of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out. Their correspondence left him deeply impressed. As it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird. When Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone. Most of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes, and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings. The editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting.

Its owner believes that <color=#ffffffd9>\"Art is the best seasoning for good food,\"</color> and will often invite artists from various walks of life to perform at the restaurant. The intricate interior design also ensures that guests will be able to view the performance no matter where they sit. For those who love art, such displays may be even lovelier than choice food. At the restaurant, you can try Fontainian Foie Gras alongside this red wine blend of Sassica and Ornella, produced on Erinnyes, as well as a special cake that goes on sale only once a week. The waiter at the restaurant, Sanguinetti, believes that not every well-dressed gentleman or lady is as elegant in their tastes as their appearance might indicate. The question about the oldest and most expensive wine terrifies him."

Modeste was hailed as a genius and the greatest chef in Fontaine, while Savelli was called a mediocre and a failure. In the prime of his life, Modeste suddenly died, and rumors began to spread in the Court of Fontaine that Savelli was to blame. With Modeste's death, the decline of the Hotel Debord began.

The palace's limited budget and lack of advanced equipment meant that she could only prepare simple dishes, preventing Escoffier from fully demonstrating her culinary genius. As a result, she needed a well-equipped restaurant where she could prepare desserts for Furina, then carefully pack and seal them, and deliver them to the court. Then the owner of the Hotel Debord, Vaneigem, made an offer to Escoffier, creating a special position for her as \"Technical Head Chef.\" Now she was formally on par with the hotel's head chef and was free to use even the rarest and most expensive ingredients to create unrivaled dishes for Lady Furina. At that time, the head chef was an old and experienced woman who had already chosen her successor. However, seeing Escoffier's advantages in all areas of culinary art, she decided to give the two young chefs the opportunity to measure their strength in a friendly competition. Escoffier did not disappoint the expectations placed on her. She cooked a bowl of Wave-Kissed Sands — a dish that appears simple and unassuming at first glance but whose preparation is fraught with potential pitfalls. The dish left those who tasted it stunned, and even her rival was convinced that Escoffier should take her place as the new head chef. Thus, Escoffier became the youngest head chef in the history of the Hotel Debord. The commemorative badge that Furina had given her — now a symbol of her personal image — would grow to embody the pinnacle of cutting-edge gastronomy. Under her leadership, the chefs of the Hotel Debord expanded the boundaries of the possible, improving the quality of each dish in their repertoire. Even the most pedantic critics could not find any flaws in their work. In just six months, Escoffier had reached the pinnacle of her profession. She was declared the most celebrated chef in Fontaine after Modeste and was able to recreate the recipe for his famous cake, changing some of the ingredients. In keeping with tradition, this cake is also sold in only sixteen servings a day."

Over time, Modeste began to believe that the taste of the Gateau Debord had changed, although people said that they did not feel the difference. The chef always strived for perfection; he did not tolerate even the slightest flaws, so he immediately stopped selling the Gateau Debord and locked himself in the kitchen, devoting days and nights to research and experiments. But with each new attempt, he only moved further away from the original taste, until one day he realized that he could not even taste coffee. And then it became clear that it was not the Gateau Debord that had changed, but his taste buds. The most brilliant chef of his time realized that he had lost his taste forever, and in despair, he decided to take his own life, using up the last reserves of the substance. A hundred years later, the Fontaine Research Institute synthesized a drug called lumiline from the Lumitoile. It was used to treat people with impaired responses to stimuli, but overuse could have mood-altering effects and even lead to nerve damage, so it quickly ended up on the Gardes list of controlled substances. Unfortunately, some products with the addition of lumiline managed to hit the market before its side effects became known. Such products ended up in the kitchen of the Hotel Debord, and Chef Escoffier decided to take responsibility, as a result of which she was accused and imprisoned in the Fortress of Meropide. And although she didn't stay there long, she never returned to the Hotel Debord, but became a chef at the Spina di Rosula tavern in the Fleuve Cendre."

She also stayed late every day and made the Gateau Debord, but she could not replicate Escoffier's taste. One of the employees was so mentally and physically exhausted that he could not even get out of bed, and then Escoffier decided to intervene. According to an old tradition established by Modeste, a culinary duel was held between the chefs, in which Escoffier was joined by Monica from the Hotel Debord and the Traveler. Although Escoffier and the Traveler were confident in the result, it turned out that the cake was deliberately ruined, and Savanna won. As a result of her victory, she demanded the original manuscript of Modeste, an old diary where he wrote down all his recipes and thoughts, from Escoffier. Although she left a copy of the diary with Savanna, she believed that Escoffier had intentionally changed the recipe for the Gateau Debord. After receiving the manuscript, the chef found no changes in it and fainted from shock."

Escoffier and the Traveler set off to rescue Savanna, and it turned out that Monica had been blackmailing her all this time. She deliberately added lumiline to the chef's food to make her more nervous and aggressive, and also brewed lumiline tea for a restaurant worker to make him sick. Monica was a descendant of Modeste, and from his manuscripts she learned about the substance that was added to the Gateau Debord. Realizing that it was not just a kitchen ingredient, but a real drug, she decided to make a fortune off of it and lured Savanna there by blackmail. When Monica was stopped and Savanna was saved, Escoffier revealed that the chef could not replicate the taste of the cake because Monica had damaged the heating elements in the ovens, and they showed a different temperature. Then they tested the culinary duel again, in which Escoffier easily won, but despite the defeat, Savanna finally believed in herself."

Chesil was ready to give up the ore, but one of the watchmakers saw the ore left over after unsuccessful processing attempts. They liked that the ore was very strong and made parts for a clock mechanism from it. Then Chesil decided to establish an uninterrupted supply of ore for the manufacture of mechanical watches and even wanted to make a special watch with elements of the Melusine style.

The workshops are headed by two brothers: Livre and Caron, who are in a strained relationship. One day, Livre planned a project called \"Champion Duelist Plan,\" which was supposed to advertise the release of their new clockwork toys. The workers at Leschots Workshop asked the Traveler and Paimon to collect combat data for the project and conduct an investigation in Lepaute Horlogeries since the latter's toys turned out to be very popular. Caron immediately understood his brother's plan and volunteered to reveal a new toy inspired by the adventurer from Mondstadt, Bennett. They met in Springvale when Caron was about to leave Mondstadt. Bennett was unable to complete the order to deliver the food on time, as he was attacked by monsters on the way, and the dish was spoiled. Caron volunteered to help Bennett prepare a new dish, but the wood in the fire got wet, a large hole appeared in the bottom of the pot, and while they were trying to fix it, several stones flew into them from nowhere. In the end, the order was carried out, although the client complained that while eating, he broke a tooth on a stone. Bennett later showed Caron various hard-to-reach places in Mondstadt to express his gratitude. The road was not easy, but the unusually beautiful views were worth it. When Caron asked Bennett if such bad luck bothered him, he simply gave him a thumbs up and said, <color=#ffffffd9>\"The world is full of all sorts of people — and maybe I just happen to be the unluckiest. But thanks to that, I've also become the bravest person — and that's given me access to sights only I can see.\"</color>"

In fact, he was still angry at his brother because of the \"betrayal.\" Their family is known for its expertise in making clockwork mechanisms. Caron was good at making toys, and Livre was good at trading. Since they both loved toys, they agreed that when they grew up, they would open the best toy store in the world. But only as adults did they realize that someone had to inherit the family business - Lepaute Horlogerie. Livre had a strong quarrel with his father over this and went on a free voyage, but Caron remained. He was afraid that he would not be able to make a name for himself by turning his hobby into a profession, and then he would have to beg on his knees to return to the family workshop."

Her cuts come from unexpected angles, ignoring the direction of the thread, and sometimes suddenly seizing upon adding a completely new structure halfway through, before upending her own work once again. Sometimes, she will even draw her sword and swiftly cut the first-rate fabric before her with a clean slash, as though she were not making clothes, but rather dueling — as though she were fighting with the fabric in her hands, vying for authority, with her emerging as the ultimate victor."

The building is found at the highest point of the Court of Fontaine and is the site where all administrative affairs in the land are handled. As far as Fontainians are concerned, the Palais Mermonia is essentially the highest authority in the land. Previously, the residence of the Hydro Archon, Lady Furina, was located there. To get to it, residents had to sign up in advance and follow certain rules. Furina's apartment had a separate entrance, so it was impossible to get there from the common room in the Palais Mermonia. One day, a man tried to jump from the roof of the palace to get to the Archon, and now he is hard at work in the Fortress of Meropide. Behind the Palais Mermonia is the beginning of the Callas aquabus line, leading to the Fontaine Research Institute.\nOne day, the Acrobatic Adventure Troupe performed in front of the gates of the Palais Mermonia, and during a fiery performance, they accidentally activated the Palais's fire-fighting mechanisms. As a result, many documents were damaged due to water, the troupe's license to perform was revoked, and a new law was issued: <color=#ffffffd9>\"All acrobatic troupes must stay away from the area of the Palais Mermonia.\"</color>"

Kinich became a witness in this case, and it seemed that it was solved, but a few days later, a box with a device resembling a Natlan gun was found in an amusement park under construction. The woman who found the box hurried to deliver it to the palace, and Kinich again joined the investigation. It turned out that this relic from the time of the ancient dragons was brought to Fontaine by a gambler who urgently needed Mora. Pretending to be a Natlanese, he found an antique collector who was ready to buy the relic, but during the deal, an amusement park appeared in the agreed location overnight. Thanks to the intervention of Kinich, Duke Wriothesley, the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, and the Marechaussee Phantom, the criminal was caught, and Fontaine began to consider tightening measures against illegal gambling.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "In addition to the Chief Justice, the Palais Mermonia houses the Maison Gestion, which deals with documents, and the Maison Gardiennage, which includes the Marechaussee Phantom and the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. Both of these organizations are directly subordinate to the Chief Justice. The Maison Gestion is famous for its bureaucracy and overworking employees. One day, one of the Maison's departments was notified that they must prepare letters for other departments with the information that employees were prohibited from bringing Kameras into the Maison Gestion for non-official purposes in order to avoid leakage of classified information. Similar precedents have already happened, and one employee once took a photo of his desk to show off how he arranged everything there. He was a member of the Kamera Club and showed the photo to other members, and the next day, a memo complaining that only fish gets served for dinner was all over The Steambird. The problem was that the entire Maison Gestion did not have a department responsible for Kameras, so the employee Iaune, who was assigned this letter, could not decide who to contact: the department dealing with security issues or the personnel department. People from both departments believed that the other department should be handling this issue, so they passed the buck to each other. As a result, a Gestionnaire, Roialte, suggested dividing the case into simpler parts: the duties of the security department included preventing the use of Kameras to avoid information leakage, and the duties of the personnel department included warning that Kameras could not be brought into the Maison Gestion. Although Iaune offered the same option to each department and was refused, this time they agreed to Roialte's proposals. Each department did not want to involve others in its work and bear responsibility for everything, and with the division of responsibilities, each department bore only a small part of the responsibility.\nWhile drawing up the initiative in this case, Iaune's typewriter key disappeared. He wanted to buy a new one from the Beaumont Workshop, but since the key was the property of the Maison Gestion, repairs to the typewriter had to be carried out at the Maison's expense. If workers make repairs at their own expense and do not apply for reimbursement, then at the end of the year, when the service expenses are reviewed, this amount will not be taken into account. In this case, the calculation of funds is carried out for each item separately. First receipts are collected during the month, and then at the end of the month, they are submitted to the Maison Cardinalice for approval. This approval process is related to the approval and payment of salaries for the entire Maison Gestion. If the amount expended is too late, then the Maison Cardinalice will even need to submit it to Monsieur Neuvillette himself for approval. If he has any questions about a certain expense report, the staff member in question must submit a written report. Because of this procedure, Iaune would have to wait several months for the keys for the typewriter, so he was allowed to buy it from Estelle with a receipt to cover the costs. Since the list of items eligible for reimbursement only included \"typewriter\" and \"key,\" which was a new item, Iaune had to write a letter to Neuvillette explaining why he only needed a refund for one key.\nAfter completing the initiative, it turned out that the newest stamping machine was not working. After numerous and fruitless alignments of the document and inspection of the machine, the Traveler hit the device hard, and it finally worked. When it would seem, all the problems of the Maison Gestion were behind, it turned out that the main criminal guilty of leaking secrets using a Kamera was the person who reminded everyone of the inadmissibility of leaking information from photographs. When he took a photograph of his office, the minutes of the meeting ended up there, and the public discovered that the contents of the minutes were wildly different from what he said in his previous speeches. The news spread like wildfire, and the department became an object of ridicule. In addition, Iaune's lost key was found under another employee's desk after he submitted a request for a refund. Due to the night shifts and endless bureaucracy, Iaune fainted and was taken to the hospital.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

When the authorities of the Court of Fontaine decided to purge the Fleuve Cendre, Baker was arrested and exiled to the desert. On the way to exile, he, with the help of his henchmen, fled to Poisson, taking hostage both the city itself and the members of the Maison Gardiennage who were transporting Baker. He made several unreasonable demands, so the Marechaussee Hunters, under the direction of Emanuel Guillotin, intervened. This conflict ended with many deaths, including Baker and the Mayor of Poisson. The people of the Fleuve Cendre believed that, though they lived in a city below the city with neither rain nor sun, the workers' abundant diligence and tenacity occasionally won them the right to live on the surface, and at other times turned their underground watery realm into a residence just as beautiful as the world above. After the purge of the Fleuve Cendre, some of the tools used to build this underground city were prohibited as they could be used as weapons."

According to countless food critics, she is a \"demon chef\" who continues to breathe new life into the culinary world while sending shivers down the spines of dietary dinosaurs — those stubbornly unreceptive to change and fresh avenues in culinary evolution. While improving the industry's technology and techniques, she has successfully lowered the costs involved, effectively democratizing high-end dining and putting famous dishes on the tables of ordinary folk. According to her students and peers, she is discipline incarnate. There is no slacking on her watch — even the tiniest mistakes caused by a lapse in concentration or momentary distraction are met with scathing critiques. Crafting a dish worthy of even a perfunctory nod of approval requires absolute respect for each ingredient and the utmost sincerity and caution at every stage of the cooking process. As Navia and her other friends see it, Escoffier is a patient and thoughtful woman who finds inspiration in complex symphonies and conversations with companions alike.

When Chiori first arrived in Fontaine, she and Uther were aspiring fashion designers who dreamed of attracting the attention of the fashion world, so for some time they worked together towards a common goal. At first, they both wanted to break tradition and make unusual clothes that would bring sighs of regret into the lobby. But with every new negative feedback from clients, with every new rejection, Uther's confidence was fading. In the end, just before Fashion Week, he decided that they could not bring to life the ideas they had always dreamed of, and that was the end of their collaboration. Chiori then put everything she had on the line and gave it her all, and on the last day, she put together a collection that she was pleased with, presenting it at the show."

When he falsely accused her of being associated with criminals and the poor quality of her materials, Chiori decided to take a two-pronged approach and face off against Uther at a fashion show and then attack his reputation. When Uther's factory was closed before the Fashion Show, she, along with the Traveler and Paimon, went to the Fleuve Cendre. Since the factory was always open to visitors, they calmly walked inside and found that the production itself was in the dirt. After collecting the necessary evidence, they found themselves in a trap set by Uther. Taking over Uther, Chiori sent the Traveler and Paimon with photos to the Fashion Show. The Steambird journalist, Charlotte, used the photographs they obtained to write an exposing article, and the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse, arrested Uther.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The girl's mother grew more and more tired every day, worrying about her husband. To take care of her mother, Chevreuse didn't hesitate to take up burdens that one as young as she should never have had to shoulder, stepping into the dark currents that swirled through the Fleuve Cendre. Perhaps it was because the residents of the Fleuve Cendre had heard tell of or been on the receiving end of her upright father's care that so many helping hands were extended to her. A well-meaning shop owner gave her a job, and the couple next door often took care of her infirm mother. And when the children of the Fleuve Cendre heard that the child of a Garde had come to live among them, they flocked to her like plaintiffs and defendants, seeking her arbitration on all manner of quarrels and disputes. <color=#ffffffd9>\"Chevreuse! You gotta uphold justice, y'know!\"</color> So cried the children with one voice, before laughing as one. They did not truly intend to allow Chevreuse to determine who was at fault, but rather saw it all as merely another game. Yet the next day, Chevreuse brought a thick stack of legal materials when she went to see them, along with a notebook newly opened to the first page, and began speaking to the chortling children in a tone most serious. <color=#ffffffd9>\"Very well. Let both sides present their evidence.\"</color> And from that day forward, the Fleuve Cendre had one more enforcer of the law — the littlest one around. But unlike the law enforcement officers aboveground, all judgments rendered by Chevreuse were executed under her personal supervision. There in the sewers, she learned many ways to ensure that \"justice\" would be upheld.\nWhen a series of murders inspired by \"The Two Musketeers\" occurred during the Fontinalia Festival in Fontaine, the investigation led Chevreuse to the Fleuve Cendre. Shortly before this, one of the tavern visitors got drunk at dinner and lost his weapon, but three days later it turned up in the corner without the slightest sign of wear. In addition, residents woke up at night to the sound of gunfire. In a remote part of the sewer, Chevreuse found broken boards and several broken bottles. The criminal tried to clean up, but there were clear traces of bullets on the wall. The captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol assumed that someone had taken the weapon, brought it home, and returned it after disassembling it and examining its design. A few weeks later, they built their own musket and brought it to the Fleuve Cendre to practice shooting. A few days later, they found their target, committed a crime, and left a rainbow rose on his body, just like in the novel. The victim lived in the Fleuve Cendre. It later turned out that the killer was the sister of the author of the novel, whose mother was killed by a rich man who was trying to hide their relationship. The famous book was based on the siblings' real childhood. The deceased was an assassin sent by their father.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

One day, they were at the opera house and saw a comedy by Master Coppelius about an elusive thief who was a master of appearing and disappearing at their leisure. What is called magic is quite similar to fraud and theft. The first relies on acting and narrative creation, and the second relies on technique. The sisters had an idea of relying on their skills and technique to step onto the stage, under the shining lights, of using their brilliant performances to illuminate equally the dreams of those forced to stand, as well as those seated in luxurious VIP boxes. One of them would play \"Parsifal,\" the other, her assistant Josephine. Their first performances were in Eduardo's taverns, beside the sewers, and in front of food stalls, from being before the eyes of children, brightly shining out from beneath faces stained with ash and oil, and amidst the applause of the denizens. Subsequently, they were replaced by the bright spotlights of the splendorous theater, brilliant, burning like the sun. Just as the light of their performances illuminated both the luxurious VIP booths and the standing audience, the name \"Parsifal\" became the talk of the town in the cities, both above and below.\nDuring the Fleuve Cendre operation, the girl who always played Josephine rushed back home. All the people knew Parsifal, but an assistant is merely an assistant. But just as the assistant on stage is lopped in two by the sword, yet never harmed, and the missing pocket watch always returns to the audience unseen, the girl finally lost her \"place\" in life. And thus, she designed a \"grand magic trick\" that belonged to them."

For Parsifal, this battle turned out to be the last. Marfisa grew up in the Fleuve Cendre, and for as little as a slice or two of moldy bread, she would not flinch from pulling out a rusty blade to take the life of someone as insignificant as herself. She thought that everything up to this point seemed utterly meaningless, with nothing achieved and nothing to hope for. However, in spite of her expectations, death did not come. Once, she opened her eyes and saw a girl (most likely, Parsifal) smiling back gently, who then placed a flower behind her ear."

Marfisa started copying all spear-fighting techniques she had ever seen and found expression in her performance. It seemed like she was dancing with \"death\" itself on a stage. Once she fought with a young swordsman and the Marechaussee Hunter, Emanuel Guillotin. She was bewildered by his crafty eyes and deceived by his intentionally slow rhythm, she finally revealed a critical weakness that she normally never would, and her arm was struck by his blade, forcing her to concede that her spearmanship was inferior.

She became a purple-clad enforcer instead, upholding justice \"as it ought to be,\" until the fire of Poisson brought the criminal Parsifal before her. Marfisa wanted to seek out Guillotin and give him her all in a final duel, but he had long retired after what happened in Poisson. People said he hid his face beneath a mask and turned to strong drink, but the spear-wielder had to discover the truth behind the rumors for herself. After following the trail to the mask left behind by the swordsman, all her trials and tribulations seemed to have been rewarded at last. However, the end of that pursuit was most unexpected and had nothing to do with the justice sought by the once-legendary Champion Duelist. Like Emanuel Guillotin, Marfisa was dissolved by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo's members. When she fell into those pure source waters, all that had previously seemed self-evident lost its meaning. Up to the moment her memories dissolved in the water, she never knew that the Lumidouce Bell's true meaning in the language of flowers was never hope. And at the end of that long pursuit, even fate did not offer her the blossoming elegy that it ought to have."

When the Traveler escorted her to the Café Lutece, Guijarro became nervous that the coffee might be poisoned. When the owner of the café, Arouet, threatened to throw her out if she continued to scare his customers, she apologetically bought three more cups of coffee.

But then, both the Maison Gardiennage and the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol adopted muskets as their standard issue, and stopped ordering bows in bulk since they require so much training to master. The research group and the team were disbanded, and the prototype remained with Lepine-Pauline, unused, until it was used as a prop in a science fiction film about \"Mechanically Enhanced Warriors.\" The invisible protagonist, \"The Prophet,\" used it to silently take down all sorts of enemies. The bow became popular among fans of fantasy films, so Lepine-Pauline brought it to the amusement park to demonstrate it, and decided to give it to the Traveler, the heart and soul of the Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland, the one who united all the legendary characters. After learning of the bow's original purpose, fans hoped that it would fall into the hands of a true master who could reveal its full potential, and Lepine-Pauline would like the Traveler and their friends to continue the bow's story beyond the screen.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

To this day, newlyweds in love throw coins into the Fountain of Lucine, wishing for peaceful and happy lives.\nAll Fontainians were Oceanids once, who, according to a legend, emerged from the tear of the first Hydro Archon, Egeria. The increase in the number of the Oceanids did not require any pairing off or matchmaking. After gaining sufficient understanding and emotion, they approached the Hydro Archon or an elder for permission to \"reproduce,\" which resulted in their division into little Oceanids. Some believed their \"reproduction\" served as a permit, granting permission for the dreams and desires within Oceanids to be bestowed with a new name — much like the names of childhood dreams throughout the ages. After some Oceanids became humans, they forgot about their origin. They still asked permission to \"reproduce,\" but it was considered a symbolic act. They threw coins into the Fountain of Lucine, wishing for the children, and then their wishes were granted. People believed that the spirits in the water would bless them with healthy and happy children. When Neuvillette turned the Fontainians into ordinary people, they were able to reproduce like all other inhabitants of Teyvat."

In addition, one day they drank the water of the Primordial Sea, which increased sensitivity, and heard the voice of a mysterious Oceanid calling Vacher. This Oceanid asked Vacher not to search for Vigneire, an adventurer who was dissolved by the water of the Primordial Sea, anymore. Vacher was her beloved once, and after losing Vigneire, he began to dissolve other women in an attempt to return his beloved out of grief. When Vacher finally found Vigneire many years later, she didn't even want to talk to him. The consciousness of all the women he had dissolved over 20 years attacked him, and Vacher died of great fright."

This device was designed by the Hydro Archon, Focalors, and she placed her divinity along with the Hydro Gnosis there. The Oratrice converted the people's faith in justice into Indemnitium, a type of energy that powers Fontaine. If this power, accrued over five centuries, has only been used to sustain Fontainians, it could have lasted for millennia, but it has its purpose. Along with the Chief Justice, this device passed sentences in court, and its sentence has always been crucial. It once falsely accused the Fatui Harbinger, Childe, of connection to the serial dissolution case and declared the Hydro Archon guilty and to be punished via the death sentence. Although the Oratrice was used for trials, in truth its main purpose was to kill the God of Justice along with the Divine Throne when the time came. Focalors understood that only power of this magnitude could hope to destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne, shaking the rules established by Celestia and breaking through the institution that is The Seven. After the main trial of the Hydro Archon, the Oratrice was destroyed, and now only the Chief Justice Neuvillette makes final verdicts."

Feeling a look of hatred on her, Lynette decided to get to the bottom of what was happening. It turned out that the letter was left by Gillian's younger sister, who blamed Lynette for what was happening. And the look of hatred came from the director of the play: he took Lynette for the role only because of her fame as a magician's assistant. For her sake, he had to rewrite the ending of the play and simplify the role of the main character. When Lynette learned the truth, she persuaded Gillian and other members of the troupe to return to the old script and cast Gillian in the lead role. Since the actress was wearing a mask, no one noticed the substitution at first, and when the identity of the main actress was revealed, everyone was too in love with her performance to talk about the deception."

The director of the institute was Dwight Lasker, an old friend of Emanuel Guillotin, Karl Ingold, and Basil Elton, with whom he grew up in an orphanage. After the Cataclysm that occurred 500 years ago, an energy crisis arose in Fontaine, so the main focus was the search for new energy sources. Significant efforts were made to transport Primal Constructs to the Institute for thorough examination due to the noticeable technological gap between the Primal Constructs found in the ruins of Sumeru's desert and the clockwork machines prevalent during this era. Two young prodigies of the Institute, Alain Guillotin and Rene, used the characteristics of Ousia and Pneuma to construct a new kinetic core, which eventually led to the first controlled annihilation reaction."

Alain's experiments into machines were perceived by other researchers as an intention to create a mechanical dog as proof of his accomplishments in Kinematics and material science. Alain's assistant had suggested creating such a thinking machine, a thinking Kamera to be precise, so that it would take photos of those precious to Alain while he was busy. Alain found using a thinking Kamera for this reason to be pointless, but he found such a machine useful for security and surveillance applications. Seymour, Prototype 4ACV07, was the thinking machine Alain created for Mary-Ann Guillotin and takes the form of a mechanical dog. Seymour was created by Alain to protect his adoptive sister Mary-Ann and was made with the most advanced optics from the Fontaine Institute of Natural Philosophy."

Rene acquired something powerful to research that appeared after the disaster, which was very dangerous for most people, but Jakob felt his constitution became \"better\" after being exposed to it.

Although Rene found it quite sad that people from the Institute of Natural Philosophy had somewhat turned into his believers, he established the Narzissenkreuz Ordo within the Institute to give his followers a sense of belonging. The Ordo did not go unnoticed among the leaders of the Institute, but as there was no evidence of aggression or any invasive nature, the case was not pursued through official investigative channels. After the Institute disbanded, some of its former members joined the Narzissenkreuz Ordo at Mr. Ingold's invitation. Much of the continued research focused on the ancient civilization of Remuria. This led to the uncovering of an ancient copy of an unknown document within the Institute of Natural Philosophy, containing Remurian characters that seemed to be some form of phonography. This ultimately aided in the decipherment of unknown esoteric Remurian documents."

He wanted to follow her, but he was not a native of Fontaine, and the water of the Primordial Sea had no effect on him. Out of grief, Vacher began to look for ways to bring Vigneire back. One day, he found the notes of Jakob Ingold, a member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, who had conducted experiments using the water of the Primordial Sea many years ago, and decided to use this research in his experiments. Vacher began kidnapping Fontainian women the same age as Vigneire in an attempt to revive his beloved. To remain above suspicion, Vacher decided to get rid of his old identity and came up with a story about a businessman, Marcel, who had just arrived in Fontaine. He found the name Marcel in Vigneire's diary, where she chose names for her and Vacher's children."

With long-term use of Sinthe, many side effects occur, including a loss of the ability to focus or control one's emotions.

Since Delaroche had established connections with various merchants and was always ready to come to the rescue, everyone decided to elect her as the head of the Association. But even when she was at her post, she could not catch a single fry. It turned out that Delaroche uses bait that dissolves in water. When the Traveler helped her with bait, she decided to use baits that were too hard for the fish to swallow. As a result, the Traveler and Paimon left her a recipe for a simple and effective bait as a gift in the hope that now the head of the Association will learn to fish. One day, Delaroche met the Melusine Iara and taught her fishing techniques. Due to the specifics of Delaroche's skills, Iara was unable to catch a fish, so she decided to place a ball octopus in her pond and practice on it."

The golden music is long silent, only the cold music of the tides still echoes upon the remains of their grand altars.\nNear these ruins, the artist Salsa once painted a landscape, but her view was obstructed by structures created by adventurers. Therefore, Salsa decided to fight the designs and created the \"Alliance of Artists to Overthrow the Evil Organization and Protect the Future of Fontaine.\" It turned out that all these structures were installed by an adventurer and installation artist, Ubu.
