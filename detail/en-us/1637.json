My beloved suffers and I grieve.\"\nFan Jie: \"So it falls to my sword to bring judgment on those who so forsake the law.\"\nFan Jie: \"Let us away.\"\n(Fan Jie spurs his horse and heads for Wu Wang's stronghold)\n(Aside)\nFan Jie: \"Swiftly did I ride here, pursuing the sounds of merriment from afar.\"\nFan Jie: \"This, then, must be the wolf's den.\"\nFan Jie: \"If I am to rescue Zixin, I must scout their lair out with care.\"\nFan Jie: \"A good plan. We go!\"\n(Fan Jie leaps over the rear wall, exeunt.)\n(Common time)\nZixin: \"Within a lone lamp and half-burnt candles — and without lurk the wolves and tigers.\"\nZixin: \"Who could have expected such disaster? And how shall I flee this hive of villainy?\"\nScene II\n(Wu Wang enters from right through a door, drunk)\n(Aloud)\nWu Wang: \"I come and go wherever I am pleased, and even gods fall if I am not appeased.\"\n(Aside)\nWu Wang: \"Haha, got one in the day, didn't I? Hehe.\"\nWu Wang: \"That lovely, lovely lady.\"\nWu Wang: \"Now that we have made merry, as is our wont. It is time — we meet the fair maiden!\"\n(Dongtang, andante calmo)\nZixin: \"Here that impetuous drunken rascal comes. Still! The weeping candlelight is in my hand.\"\n(Aside)\nZixin: \"You shall not have me!\"\n(Wu Wang chases Zixin. Zixin strikes Wu Wang with the candlestick. He falls down. She slumps in relief.)\n(Dongtang, andante calmo)\nZixin: \"In the confusion, a stroke of fortune! On shaking feet I flee.\"\n(Aside)\nZixin: \"Not a light to be seen outside. How is this so dark?\"\nZixin: \"Perhaps I should relight this candle—\"\nZixin: \"No. Would I not be imperiled if recaptured?\"\nZixin: \"Better then to carry this unlit light, and grope our way out through the night.\"\nZixin: \"Yes, so shall it be done.\""
