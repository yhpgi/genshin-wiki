As such, the combat doctrine co-authored by the Fatui and the Royal Military Academy states that they are to be organized as a \"Quick Reaction Force\" in large-scale battles, meant to guard against enemy breakthroughs or counterattacks, and to press the advantage if the battle is going favorably. Of course, all such Landcruisers have the ability to operate independently, and on long tours of duty, they can form the core of a small squad and thus maximize the firepower of various Fatui unit types...",
