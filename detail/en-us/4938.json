Rex Lapis, acknowledging his friend's contributions to Liyue, sought to immortalize his friend’s memory. This collective vow to the moon symbolized joyful solidarity, a commemoration of the past, and reflection on the present, which is the essence of the Moonchase Festival. Each year, the Moonchase Festival adopts a unique theme, usually chosen by the Qixing. One folktale claimed that the ancients found the Stove God's shrine, but there was no statue — only a huge, smooth slab of stone.</color>"

He once walked over the barren plains with the people until arriving at last at the harbor. He joined humans in building their dwellings and lighting the stoves. It was his hand that lit the very first street lamp of Liyue and brought the aroma of cooked food into every household in the land. Mortals no longer remember him, but back in the age when they did, he was the closest of all the Adepti to the common folk.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The Traveler’s first Moonchase Festival consisted of the theme \"Feast of the Bounteous Land\" which included a cooking competition called \"Masterful Chefs,\" as chosen by the Liyue Qixing. Xiangling, a talented and passionate young chef from Liyue, sought inspiration for a cooking competition and recruited the Traveler and Paimon to gather ideas. They encountered various people and gained different perspectives of the \"perfect dish.\" Xiangling advanced in the Masterful Chefs competition after presenting three new test dishes: Chicken Foo Yung, Come and Get It, and Crystal Shrimp. Feedback from the people of Liyue prompted her to make adjustments for the finals, where she presented Jueyun Chili Chicken, Triple-Layered Consommé, and Crystal Shrimp, and ultimately won the competition against Smiley Yanxiao, who was then the second finalist.</color>"

She ducked inside to get out of the rain and put the Cornbread Buns on an offering table she saw there. She fell asleep, and when she woke up, Guoba had eaten every last one. Guoba has followed her around ever since. Then suddenly, the stone cracked and revealed Guoba to be the Stove God, Marchosius. Madame Ping explained that Marchosius had always been a deity with great affection for the people, and acted in response to their desires. Passion alone will not suffice to reawaken Marchosius from his deep slumber, but when Keqing ate Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns, a traditional folk-food snack, a deeply held desire was fulfilled. The enormous power unleashed by the fulfillment of this desire resonated with Marchosius’s statue and caused it to manifest once more the form it took in the past. Guoba may have lost many of his former faculties, but he is now as carefree as can be, without a single worry in the whole world. Those with a mind and with knowledge will certainly be troubled by all manner of things. His carefree demeanor today is a testament to the fact that he is at rest.</color>\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
