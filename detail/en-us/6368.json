But Monstadt's gates are open to everyone, and he would have been quite welcome even without the recommendation letter.\nIn fact, Albedo's life in Mondstadt may even have been more comfortable without it.\nThis is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer, Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir.\nAfter receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests.\n\"So, Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\"\nAnd just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.\nThe work of the Knights was actually quite easy for Albedo, requiring only five percent of his energy.\nThe rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal, he thought.\nAnd yet...\nAlice has a daughter, named Klee.\nYes, \"that\" Klee.\n\"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\"\nFrom that day forth, cleaning up after Klee would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 3</color>\nAlbedo has no memory of any blood relations. From as far back as he can remember, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master.\nOf course, Miss Alice, the Knights of Favonius, and that traveler who had a sense of the stellar depths about them... They are all important people. And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.\nFor Albedo, she is his only kin.\nShe was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy.\n\"The universe is the sable essence of the true starry sky... Earth is the accumulated memory of time and being...\nChalk: that is you. Soil is where alchemy derives its name, and is the basis of all life. And this...\"\nShe demonstrated her technique before him as a huge life form burst from its culture tank in a shower of shattered fragments.\n\"...This is new birth.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 4</color>\nAlbedo once led a simple and content existence.\nThere was no need for him to contemplate anything. Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.\nBut one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.\nAnd with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.\nUpon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\"\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\nIn the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?\n\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 5</color>\nThe alchemy that Albedo commands is wholly different from any of the arts practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat.\nIts lineage can be traced back to the nation of Khaenri'ah.\nKhaenri'ah was an underground realm, with precious few natural fauna. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.\nThis art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\"\nAlbedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.\nThe next stage after \"soil\" is \"chalk,\" which was also something his master had mentioned.\n\"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\"\nNow, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.\n\"From soil was birthed chalk.\"\nThe profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.\nSuch ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.\nShe was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.\n\"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?\"\nFrom time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment."

My elder siblings treated me well, and later, many younger ones came along — and I treated them just as my elder siblings treated me.\nLater, we left the world beneath the earth. I felt the wind brushing against my skin, the warmth of the sun, waters icy and warm.\nLife is wonderful — and it was wonderful that I was able to witness this world!\nOnly later did I discover that I was different from the life in this world. The things that brought me happiness, the things that interested me... they were frightening and terribly hurtful to those of this world.\nEventually, I fell here and died. That saddened yet gladdened me. I treasured the life I was given by Mother, but my life would bring everyone such pain... so it was better this way.\nLater, just as Mother gave me life, I gave my children life, that they may walk upon this world — that makes me very proud and very happy."
