In a desperate attempt to reverse fate, she caused the Bishui River to overflow its banks, destroying everything downstream. Herblord and Fujin could not allow people to die, so they went against their goddess. According to legend, Herblord delayed the goddess with a battle, and Fujin threw the Votive Rainjade into the water, which stopped the river from flooding. Lingyuan summoned her familiars, the Xuanwen beasts, to help her friends and drive the people into the caves. During the war, Herblord spent a lot of her energy, and later left Chenyu Vale and found her home in Liyue Harbor.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
