Not even a trace of civilization remains...\nWell, no need to wax nostalgic then. Let's just get through this place first.\nWatch the strange glowing fish\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat strange, glowing fish... Paimon never thought we'd run into it here too.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Continue onward</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa... Looks just like that glowing fish we saw before!\nThere are still weird things tangled around the top nearby... What the heck is going on? Paimon's getting more and more confused...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI've heard this voice in a dream before...\nI can't remember his name anymore, though...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nYes, you must have met him in the Sebastos's dream, did you not?\nScylla, a fell dragon who once served the Sebastos. He was subdued and sealed here by Boethius.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEhh!? Mr. Super Rude subdued an evil dragon? Paimon didn't think he could do something that amazing...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nWell, \"fell dragon\" was the name they gave, but it was no more than a vishap that was a teensy bit stronger than normal. After all, no new Hydro Dragon could be born so long as the Mistress of Many Waters hibernated in the deep seas.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I never thought that vishaps could get this large.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nHmph. After all, they are little more than uncultured barbarians. It would be unsurprising if they grew into something much stranger.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Speaking of which, isn't Neuvillette...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's right! Neuvillette's the Hydro Dragon, isn't he? That doesn't mean that this guy's way older than even him, does it?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nA new Dragon of Water has already been born? Then again, it has been a long time since even the former Mistress of Many Waters passed... So much time has passed...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nIn any case, the evil dragon Scylla was once the Sebastos's friend, but he revolted at a critical juncture in the showdown between us Remurians and the... Fontainians.\nAt that time, Scylla led the brutal Dragonborn to Machimos, intent on breaching the inner city, Capitolium, where the Sebastos resided.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Machimos?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I heard people talking about that in town.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah, the people in town were always talking about some Machimos, and a belltower or something...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nCorrect. \"Machimos\" is the outer city of the capital, but should the fell dragon wish to enter the inner city, he must pass through the Initium Iani.\nThat is the barrier separating the inner and outer parts of the capital, and the Symphony weaved by the Sebastos and the musicians which covered all of Remuria passed through the Initium Iani and its golden waterways.\nBoethius and his legions used this fact to shut the Initium Iani, thus finally sealing the evil dragon.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\n(Something's not right about that story...)\n(The dreamscape from before... Back then...)\n(Scylla should have come and seen Remus before...)\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nPerhaps Scylla sought to go before the Sebastos's throne, but such an opportunity is now forever lost. Afterward, the evil dragon sank alongside Remuria, and the Sebastos too was lost, remaining so to this very day...\nDid you recall something, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nIt all feels a bit muddled...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nThat is true... I only heard tell of events after it had all transpired myself, having not been in the capital when the disaster struck...\nThen, none knew just what had happened to the Sebastos. I fear that we can only learn more by proceeding further.\nThe large glowing fish that we saw in the castle must be the thoughts that escaped from fissures in Scylla's stony cell.\nI fear he has already taken notice of our presence. Having been sealed here for so long, now that he's finally sensed outsiders, he will naturally find a way to lure us in.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo that's it...\nHang on a minute! You said that the way to Domus Aurea is through those gates or something, but hasn't Boethius shut them already? Doesn't this mean there's no getting through?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nThis will prove quite tricky, yes...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nBah, there's gotta be a limit to how rude you can be! What's with this \"I'll wait for you at Domus Aurea, mwahaha!\" nonsense when you won't even leave the door open, huh!?\nY'know, why don't we find some way to break the seal on the evil dragon, and get the former foe he beat to break the door down for us?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nNo! How could we do such a thing!? I mean, after, that is one of Remuria's nemeses...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>But the enemy of my enemy is my friend, no?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>But Remuria is long gone, no?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's right. It's been so long. For all you know, he might've decided to turn over a new leaf and be a nice dragon!\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nBut he is still a dragon...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh, come on, so what? Even if he is a dragon, he might be the reasonable kind we can talk with. We've got experience in dealing with dragons, don't we, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Well, there was that time with Dvalin...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYup, that bit where he kicked up a storm in Mondstadt while under the influence of a curse. We had a big fight because of it, too...\nThe additional dialogue option appears if the player has completed <color=#ffe14b>Story Quest - Historia Antiqua Chapter II: No Mere Stone (Zhongli Story Quest Act 2)</color> <color=#ffffffa6>.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We had that little run-in with Azhdaha...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nRight, he was trying to break that seal, so we teamed up with everyone and had to beat him together before we could reseal him...\nThe additional dialogue option appears if the player has completed <color=#ffe14b>Story Quest - Sapientia Oromasdis Chapter II: Homecoming (Nahida Story Quest Act 2)</color> <color=#ffffffa6>.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We encountered Apep in the desert...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nRight, she even went on about wanting to destroy Sumeru... And then we had to defeat the anomalous lifeforms within her before we managed to get her healthy again...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh, those examples weren't very convincing, were they...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nC—C'mon, Osse, no amount of suspicious looks is going to suddenly give us better options!\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n*sigh* I know. You're right. Let's give it a try.\nThe seals that bind the evil dragon seem to be connected to three locations. Let us begin by removing the chains in those three places.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Monsieur Os\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nI still have my concerns... If upon his release he should prove as brutal as he was back then, it will be difficult to subdue him once more...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Break the chains that bind Scylla</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Step Description:</color> <color=#ffffff>Follow the direction in which the chains in the Sea of Bygone Eras extend and find a way to break them</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>At the chain to the South of</color> <color=#ece5d8>Initium Iani</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nLooks like there are lots of golems here!

Is that you?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Nameless Golem:</color>\nIt is you! Just as I thought! You've finally returned...\nI was ordered to guard this fortress, but the cruel Vishaps and attacks of the barbarians were simply too much for me, so I was forced back step by step until I arrived here.\nIt seems as though many, many years have passed since then... What tidings from beyond? Were we victorious?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Nameless Golem:</color>\n...Is that so? Then we lost.\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nI am sorry...\n<color=#ffffff>Nameless Golem:</color>\nDo not say such things, Honored Dominus. I had already imagined this day might come when I joined the Sebastos's legions.\nDid the Sebastos not say that he wanted to lead us to break the shackles of \"Fortuna\"? But is doing so that simple?\nAfter all, what we struggle against is fate itself, and defying fate is a feat beyond even the greatest of the gods.\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nIn the end, all our efforts were in vain...\n<color=#ffffff>Nameless Golem:</color>\nNay, say not so, Dominus. We took up arms against divine destiny, and our deeds challenged the laws of heaven. We resisted that prophecy, resisted it most valiantly...\nThough we failed in the end... Someone must have betrayed us, led us astray...\nStill, the outcome no longer matters. Come what may, our deeds shall be carved into this world's \"history\"...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey! Why did he just fall over like that? Can stone people also just... suddenly faint?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nI still do not know his name... It appears his \"history\" has now reached its conclusion.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWait, that's so sad! Has he just been fighting here, all these thousands of years?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nBut now, he is finally at peace. Let us continue onward.\n...Quickly, undo the chains here.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Monsieur Os\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nThose souls... The shadows of the past lingering here... If we can defeat Boethius, perhaps they too can at last find peace...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Why would their souls...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nObsession? Delusions? Regardless, the bodies created by the Sebastos offered us a sanctuary to which we could flee.\nJust as he hoped, the sea will steal neither our souls nor our lives... But it is because of this that our souls have become all the heavier.\nRather than my kin now being trapped beneath the depths by the Symphony, it is more accurate to say that they, like Boethius, are bound here by their own obsession.\nA pitiable fate...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Pet him)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's nothing.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nAlright. If there is anything you wish to know, do not hesitate to ask me.\nAt <color=#ffffff73>the chain to the East of</color> <color=#ece5d8>Initium Iani</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm, it looks like it's been entangled by some kind of strange plant, seems complicated..\nThe ancient creatures within this region of water have been under the continual influence of the golden melodies. We can use the power of the \"symphony\" to interfere with them somewhat...\nSolve the puzzle\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWell, now we just need to go and remove the remaining chains!\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Monsieur Os\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nThe chains wrap around that stone pillar. The power of the \"symphony\" should be able to loosen their grip...\nBreak the chain\n<color=#ffffff>\"O you gods, shut tight the brass gates of the heavenly city! The sword of Remus has cut the threads of fate, and once land and sea alike have been conquered, all that shall remain is the path to the skies...\"</color>\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nImperator, Imperator, are you alright? Are you dreaming again?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nUgh, so noisy. What's going on...\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nThe people have gathered in your great hall. I believe they have questions for you, Imperator.\nRecently, the melody of Phobos has been interrupted many times, and so they have many concerns regarding this.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI have no choice but to do this...\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nI trust your wise judgment, naturally, and I have heard something of the recent happenings... Is something wrong with Phobos?\nPhobos has planned routes for everyone, such that humanity as a whole can attain happiness. There should be no issues, not when we have the aid of Sybilla's nearly limitless powers of calculation...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nBut I heard cries of sorrow within the music.\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nDid someone secretly alter the musical score of Phobos? No, none can do that except myself and the other Harmosts...\nCould it be that the prophet had hidden something from us? Impossible. Has she not already sacrificed her very life for the cause? The veracity of her prophecy has been validated by the Mistress of Waters. She would have harbored no such selfish designs...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nOr perhaps it is precisely because \"she\" had no desires of her own...\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nToday, all people rely on Phobos to make judgments and decisions for them. If something were to go wrong with it, the citizens fear that all would descend into chaos...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI need you to go to where those who cling to blind faith are...\nFor this reason, I must grant you free will.\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nIs that to say you wish to separate my melody from the Grand Symphony as a contingency against mishaps?\nNo, no, it is still too early. I fear my soul is still unable to withstand such great fate...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI believe in you.\nBut from now on, you shall no longer be part of \"we\"...\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\n...I understand. I have resolved myself. If this is your wish, Imperator, I shall see it done.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nOuranopolis, the city of the future...\nCall yourself by this new name.\n<color=#ffffff>After ████ has departed, you pass through golden corridors, and the sounds of people in debate grow closer.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>The area grows quiet, but only by a little, when you reach the central podium of the main hall.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nO Great Sebastos, please, give us your instructions...\nMany have been unable to hear the Phobos's melody as of late. The people are frightened, Imperator, frightened and confused.\nOur grand plan was proceeding as normal. The barbarians skulking in the shadows were being eliminated one by one, and the polluted waters were cleansed by Ichor.\nYet, my Imperator, you plan to call a halt to our noble war without cause or reason. Why have you done this?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI exercised my own judgment in the matter.\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nGreat Sebastos, I do not mean to challenge your authority, but I believe that you have shown them sufficient mercy already.\nWe have brought glorious harmony to the land. The gates of Remuria are open to all who wish to join in our golden order.\nBut what have they done? They have destroyed our towers and slaughtered our musicians. Their blighted souls are unworthy of any salvation!\nWe cleanse their barbarous lands with blood, and order and civilization shall sprout after the destruction. For such ignorant savages, this is the highest mercy that can be granted them.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nThat is not what I want...\n<color=#ffffff>████:</color>\nBut there should not be even a sliver of shadow under the sun. Is that not also your great ideal?\nIf I may, Imperator, I believe that this is the wish of all citizens of Remuria.\nSebastos, please, give the order!\n<color=#ffffff>\"Defiled, defiled! Defiled are all who dwell in Capitolium! If blood will not wash this land clean, how shall guiltless flowers again bloom?\"</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat's going on with you, Traveler? Now's not the time to rest! Hurry up and unchain these shackles!\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nYou saw it again, didn't you...\nThe Sebastos's...\nAt the chain to the Northwest of <color=#ece5d8>Initium Iani</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nHey, you! Yes, you! You gibbering imbecile! Why do you delay!? Even if we waste away, the treasure won't move itself, surely!\n<color=#ffffff>The Dude They Call \"Idiot\":</color>\nNay, sir! It's just that they are simply too heavy! We've been at this all day, yet there's still so much left...\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nWhere, then, is the intrinsic merit in feeding that prodigious size of yours!? It's treasure, you brute, treasure! Of course it's heavy!\nBesides, we \"confiscated\" all these treasures from those accursed barbarians, did we not?\nLeaving such wealth in the hands of those insects who live like swine and mongrels would be a terrible waste!\n<color=#ffffff>The Dude They Call \"Idiot\":</color>\nBut Sir, don't you think we should've brought a few more ships if we wanted to haul all this back to Remuria?\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nWhat are you, slow? Imperial cargo ships are not to be used for such a thing!\n<color=#ffffff>The Dude They Call \"Idiot\":</color>\nWell, why don't we destroy what we cannot carry? Better than to having it fall into the hands of these savages!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh, is it just Paimon, or have we heard this conversation before...?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Sounds like when we first arrived in Petrichor...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's that bit with the \"Treasure Hoarders\" all over again.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah, those unlucky adventurers we drove off before were saying similar stuff.\nFeels like this round's worse than the last, too!\nIs it possible they were turned into golems after the boat they were on sank?\nThat's so creepy!\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nAre you of Legio IX? What are you doing here? Should you all not have been ordered to retreat to Fort Charybdis?\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nHey, Este! Don't you dare ruin our fun, you hear?\nThese barbarians are less of a threat than dead fish anyway, so just let us have our fun messing about here for a while longer, would you?\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nThese treasures... *sigh* I don't know what orders your Harmost gave you...\nBut did the Sebastos not order us to subdue these ignorant tribes and free them of fate's shackles? Those orders do not include such... clearly criminal deeds\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nHah? Surely you jest! The orders of our commander, mighty Dominus Boethius, were indeed to punish these savages harshly.\nAnd besides, we have received no punishment. That means that both Phobos and the Sebastos, our Imperator, approve of our actions.\nSo what's all this talk about crimes... Are you trying to start trouble?\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nBut...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThere's another Este here? Well, aren't things getting weirder by the moment?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nIt appears that it is time to answer that question of yours.\nThe Este you met in town must be a descendant of Remurians. His ancestor must have followed me to join the new nation all those years ago, becoming an ordinary Fontainian.\nAs such, the \"symphony\" that has stolen these Fontainians' souls would not affect him. But in turn, the melody that records his ancestor's memories had nowhere to go, and so attached itself to that statue.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo you mean that the Este here is Town-Este's ancestor, the real \"Este the Quick-Witted\"? What about the others?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nJust wandering souls, lost in their memories. Let us go have a look.\n<color=#ffffff>You walk up together with Monsieur Os...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHello there, Este.\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nYes, hello. And who are you, exactly?\nYou do not appear to be Remurians. Are you savages, then?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I'm just a passing traveler.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Oh, I can get pretty savage.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nWell, this is a battlefield, and you put yourselves in great peril. You should leave this place, regardless of who you are.\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nEste, it is I. It has been a while.\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\n...Skies above, it's you, Dominus Cassiodor! You so rarely appear in this form that I almost failed to recognize you.\nAnd as for these two... Are they your attendants?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>You can just take that to be so.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Actually, I'm his owner.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\n...Huh?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, hey, Traveler, stop complicating things further! Don't worry, he/she was just joking, Este, so please, continue.\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nStill, Dominus Cassiodor, what brings you here? Did the Sebastos not send you to... Damnation! I cannot remember! Am I in some dream?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nThat does seem to be the case.\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nHaha! Surely you jest! The Sebastos must have assigned you some secret mission again, or else I am an ignoramus!\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nYou guess correctly. Speaking of which, why are the legionnaires of Legio IX guarding those chains?\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nThe chains... You mean the treasure, yes? I believe them to be spoils of war.\nThough the Sebastos views war as naught but a sad necessity in fulfilling our grand aspirations and has long outlawed such brutal behaviors...\nYou know as well as I that they have become commonplace nonetheless... We are on the path of darkness, though none perceive it.\nDominus Cassiodor, what has happened? Phobos was meant to bring us happiness, but all I feel is a pain I cannot name...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nI, too, am searching for the answer to that question. But it appears that we will have to deal with the problem at hand first.\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nIndeed. Still, those are our legionnaires, so let us solve things peacefully, if we may.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAhem, legionnaires of Legio IX!\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nHuh? Who are you? Este's little helpers?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That we are.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWe're no ordinary helpers! Mighty are we who have come with Dominus Cassiodor, to attend and aid him.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We are special envoys of the Imperator, our Sebastos.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat kinda rank is that... Well, that's not completely wrong. We're with Dominus Cassiodor.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We are Cassiodor's retainers.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's right! Dominus Cassiodor's retainers, that's who we are!\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n(It seems you two have quite the penchant for acting.)\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nDominus Cassiodor, you say... I heard that the Sebastos had sent him to Aremorica. Has he returned so soon?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWell, the one next to us is, in fact...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWh—Whatever the case, we have come to survey the frontline legions!\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nRight. I figured as much.\nI mean, we haven't gone to Fort Charybdis with the main body of troops...\nBut we are the rearguard, so some final \"cleanup\" is well within our range of duties, eh?\n<color=#ffe14b>Trust Meter</color> appears\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nIs this also a command from Phobos?\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nWell... It should have guided our every move, but since coming here, there have been many times when we could not hear its melody.\nAs such, we've fallen back on Dominus Boethius's directives.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Ah, that impudent fellow...</color>\n<color=#ffe14b>Trust Meter</color> <color=#ffffff73>decreases</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nWho do you think you are!? How dare you impugn Dominus Boethius's name so flagrantly!\nA Harmost as esteemed as he follows the directives of the Sebastos in all things. His word is as the word of Phobos itself.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>The Sebastos does not permit the harm of innocent people.</color>\n<color=#ffe14b>Trust Meter</color> <color=#ffffff73>increases</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nInnocent, you say... Yes, he did task us with helping these vulnerable humans before the war began.\nBut our actions have the tacit approval of Phobos. Could its decrees ever be in conflict with the sacred word of the Sebastos?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Phobos could have made a mistake as well.</color>\n<color=#ffe14b>Trust Meter</color> <color=#ffffff73>decreases</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nHah! Are you sure you're Remurian? Do you not know that Phobos was fashioned by the omnipotent Sebastos and the infallible oracle?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Yet you are not receiving the melody.</color>\n<color=#ffe14b>Trust Meter</color> <color=#ffffff73>increases</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nWell, that is true enough. But in what can we place our trust, if not Phobos?\nSurely it would not stand idly by, were we to diverge from the correct path?\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nPhobos is a perfect creation. I counsel you, as a Remurian, to not doubt its directives.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Perfect? Nothing is truly perfect.</color>\n<color=#ffe14b>Trust Meter</color> <color=#ffffff73>decreases</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nWhat are we doing now, debating sophistry? Take it up with those musical erudites in the capital. A soldier's duty is to obey. Complex matters are not my strong suit...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Phobos's silence signifies rejection.</color>\n<color=#ffe14b>Trust Meter</color> <color=#ffffff73>increases</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nYes... That is possible. How did I not consider that? Could our rash actions have caused Phobos to cease guiding us?\nIf so... Then it bodes very ill...\nThere are 2 options for following dialogue:\nA successful negotiation was made.\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nVery well... You speak true. We must reconsider our actions. I... In truth, I do not know how things came to this...\nThere's been a strange feeling in my heart since this war broke out.\nWe were meant to pursue freedom and happiness, but Phobos led us here instead, step by step...\nHas something gone wrong? What could it be?\nIf you meet with the Sebastos upon your return, please apprise him of our circumstances and our doubts.\nYou'll be doing us a truly great favor.\nDon't worry, we will!\nA successful negotiation was not made.\n<color=#ffffff>Leader:</color>\nYou... Come to think of it, you could be barbarians in disguise, attempting to deceive us! You are, aren't you!?\nYou damnable worms, I shall slay you where you stand!\nDefeat the golems\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nAt least we finally got those two to withdraw. Now, none shall stand in the way of us removing the chains here.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Este\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nGod King Above, thank you, Dominus Cassiodor. In any event, it seems that this issue has been resolved for now.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Monsieur Os\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nLet us continue onward. It is time to end this story of the \"past.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>So, what's the deal with you and Este...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nAs you have seen, he was a friend of mine, and one of the survivors of Remuria's destruction.\nIn later days, he followed me into the newborn Fontaine and was laid to rest there.\nThe spring waters responded to us, who were entrapped in rock, just as it did ordinary Fontainians, and he had children of his own, building a family there...\nHis bloodline became joined to that of Fontaine, and all came to forget that he was no ordinary mortal.\nA good fate, no?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Pet him)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>It's nothing.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nAlright. If there is anything you wish to know, do not hesitate to ask me.\nDispel the chain\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nIt seems that you've resolved our previous problem.\nI suppose that means you'll be rushing ahead toward your next goal, then?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nYes. I'll be counting on you to take care of this place, Este...\nAlso, remember that is better to trust the wisdom of your heart rather than handing all judgment of right and wrong over to Phobos or any Harmost.\nThe Sebastos created Phobos to free us from our servitude to destiny, but the people's blind faith has led us into enslavement more frightful still.\nIn the future, you may encounter a similar choice once more. I hope you will make the right decision with the time comes.\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nDominus Cassiodor, why are you suddenly speaking of such things?\nStill, I shall keep your words in my heart. I, Este, shall uphold my own sense of justice.\nThat is good. Farewell, Este. I believe we shall meet again.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Este\n<color=#ffffff>Este:</color>\nI have indeed received Dominus Cassiodor's message. No matter what others may do, I will not stray from my path.\nBut even if we continue like this, even if our legions conquer all before them, just what will the future of this nation be like...?\nWe have no choice but to rely upon the wisdom of the Sebastos...\nFree Scylla\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAll the chains have been broken. Now then, time to check things out at the Initium Iani!\n<color=#ece5d8>Initium Iani</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Head to where Scylla is</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nAhhh! Such warm ocean currents! Free at last!\nWell now, little ones. Hail you from the surface? I know not for what reason you have come to this deepwater prison, but...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWe aren't \"little\" anything! You're just way too big!\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nHaha! Very well! Either way, you have broken the shackles that have bound me for millennia. That places me in your debt.\nIf there is any undertaking in which I may aid you, then speak. Consider it a token of my gratitude.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, Paimon knew you'd be a reasonable guy! Anyway, Paimon's name is Paimon, and he's/she's Traveler. And this is...\nErr, actually, Paimon's not sure what you'd know him by, but we call him Monsieur Os!\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nAh, Cassiodor, it is you. It has been a while. So you came back after all. But still, you are sadly late... by a few thousand years, no less.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOoh, looks like the big guy knows you, Monsieur Os!\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nI have nothing to say to despicable traitors.\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nSpeak not so rashly, mortal! We are dragon-born. We keep all our promises and betray none, which is more than can be said for your haughty race.\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nSave your breath! It is worth less than a drowning mayfly! Your betrayal is undisputed. Were we not defeated in that war precisely because you turned against us?\nIf we hadn't lost that war... our nation... the Sebastos... wouldn't have...\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nAh, you've been gone far too long, Cassiodor! The truth is not what you imagine... Though I suppose that a secret plan would not have been secret had its details reached your ears.\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n...Secret plan?\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nMy leading an army of vishaps to assault the capital was, in fact, part of Remus's final, secret plan.\nAnd he did all this to save his nation and people — a man of great moral character.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That sounds preposterous...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Had he gone mad, too?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah, that is kinda weird. Why would a ruler ask someone else to invade their own country?\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nAnd what, little one, would ones such as you or I know of Remus's thoughts? Whatever the case, look upon this, Cassiodor. Even you should be able to divine its meaning.\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nThe guiding golden bees... They should only heed the call of the Symphony... Why would the Sebastos bestow his power upon a savage dragon?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nBecause they had an arrangement...\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nOh? You know much, little one! From where did you learn that?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nFrom memories scattered in the sea...\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nYou speak correctly! Yes, indeed, we did have an arrangement, but I failed him. I squandered his noble sacrifice.\nI could not make it to Domus Aurea in time! And so the waves devoured the whole city, and my kindred could not escape, either...\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\n...How could such a thing be...\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nHmph! If it is betrayal you speak of, then Boethius was the true traitor!\nWere it not for that lying devil, that deceitful rat, and his silver-tongued deceptions, how could a prince among dragon-kin such as I, who once led our armies after the age of the ancient dragons, have been beaten so easily?\nThat devil first falsely claimed to have given up resistance on Remus's orders, saying he had ordered the legions to cease resistance. Yet when we arrived here, he suddenly rose up against us...\nNow that I have had much time to think on it, I fear he must have learned of Remus's plans somehow, and thus was able to set up such an inescapable trap and lure me in, step by step...\nAnd thus did my flesh and blood turn to stone, and thus did it remain for millennia, to this day, when you rescued me.\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nBoethius knew perfectly well what a massive calamity his actions would bring about, yet he still... Could he have been trying to seize control over Phobos? Was that why he committed such sins...?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nIt seems that we don't have the full story yet...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo the guy who keeps calling others traitors was actually a traitor through and through!?\nBut why, though? Ugh, are we gonna have to ask him? Paimon doubts we'd get a straight answer.\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nHmm? So that loathsome, recalcitrant demon-worm has yet to dissipate, has he?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah, and he's stolen the souls of a whole bunch of Fontainians, too! Rescuing them is actually the main reason we're here...\nHe said that he'd wait for us within Domus Aurea... Well, he just said he'd wait for Monsieur Os, so we're coming along uninvited!\nNot even leaving a door, though. How rude of him!\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nThe Initium Iani...? Hmph, though feeble tricks and smokescreens have been set to dismay us, but at the end of the day, it's nothing more than a glorified stone door.\nI may have lost my physical body, but it is no great labor to take the little ones over to settle the matter.\nWatch closely, little ones!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOooh! You're pretty reliable, huh, big guy?\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nNow we simply need to break these revealed seals one by one. If you are prepared, then let us go!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWell then, Monsieur Os, are you ready?\n<color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os:</color>\nNow that it's come to this, we have little choice.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAlright then. What about you, Traveler? Ready?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Let's go.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I need a moment to prep...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nOf course. Gird yourself sufficiently, and then, let us go. I shall wait for you below.\nGo to Scylla\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nAll ready, little ones?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Let's go.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I need a moment to prep...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nOf course. Gird yourself sufficiently, and then, let us go. I shall wait for you below.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Pass through the Initium Iani with Scylla</color>\nPress the button to have Scylla shatter the seal\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nShould we desire to open this stone door, we must shatter the stone seals adorning it one by one! Step back, little ones!\nContinue onwards\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nThere isn't much time. Keep up, little ones!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhew!
