Eberhart was one of those who wanted to restore the proud and noble aristocracy of the past in all its glory. He believed that any means were good to achieve his goal of becoming the heir of the family, so he was willing to get rid of his blood brothers or use a witch and then get rid of her when the opportunity arose. He secretly practiced fighting with a spear, a weapon unworthy of an aristocrat, for the sole purpose of defeating his lord and removing another obstacle on the path to becoming the head of the clan. To achieve his goals, Eberhart convinced his brother, Parsifal, to become a phantom thief. Having renounced his family name, Parsifal shot the crowns from the heads of the nobles in utter silence and disarmed many pursuing soldiers. He once vowed to bring light to a dark age, to bring justice, riches, and gladness to the oppressed. He walked the dark streets and taverns, mixing with the common people and, using the swordsmanship he had learned as a noble, robbing the rich and giving the money to the poor. All the maidens of Mondstadt dreamed of a noble thief, but he preferred a pint with his brothers. One day, he robbed a nobleman of his regalia and took a sapphire with him to give to the blue-eyed witch, Priscilla, but to the last, he could not bring a single smile to her beautiful face. In the end, the noble thief listened to the advice of his brothers and, abandoning his oath, sailed across an ocean that belonged to no one. He joined the Liyue warship and became the Chief Mate. When he first arrived at the harbor, he had a short blade hanging from his belt and a small sapphire feather pinned to his threadbare cloak. The hard-drinking Chief Mate was lost in a drunken reverie from morning till night, and was rarely ever sober. The smell of alcohol followed him everywhere, and he kept muttering about his warped memories. One day, the sapphire feather turned blood red, and at the last moment, Parsifal clearly remembered the days that were hidden by the veil of alcohol."

She did not only the work of a servant, but also the tasks necessary for his goals. She dreamed of being by his side, or at least in the crowd behind him. When Eberhart went on an expedition to the future Dragonspine to eliminate his remaining brother, Priscilla was to light the beacon on the Stormbearer Point if they were discovered. The expedition planned to bring back many archaeological finds to Mondstadt to strengthen the name of the Landrich Clan. Because of the inscription, they decided not to go into the dungeons of the southwestern ruins, as originally planned, and instead explore a secret room with a locked door."

During a severe snowstorm, the expedition lost several people, and then, in front of the secret room, due to Eberhart's fault, an avalanche occurred, taking away one person and the fuel and provisions they were carrying. Despite the situation, Eberhart remained calm and suggested going down into the dungeons of the southwestern ruins. When the group members split up along the way, he struck each of them one by one, unaware that Landrich was already planning to grant him a noble title after the expedition. He lured Luther and his brother, Ingbert, to a secluded place and struck the latter down with a spear. And although Ingbert, who possessed a Vision, was able to seriously wound his brother, Eberhart survived. All the talk about a \"lost civilization buried beneath the snow\" and \"a power descended from the heavens\" was just a means to an end. He knew how much Ingbert loved expeditions and adventures, and used this weakness to lure him to a secluded place where no one could help him. After killing his brother, the wounded Eberhart was going to go east, where the mountain meets the sea, and take a boat. In Mondstadt, the conspiracy of Eberhart and Priscilla was discovered. And even when the blue-eyed witch saw the mocking crowd and the swords reflecting the moonlight, she felt neither offense nor grief, and to the last she believed that the former glory of the aristocracy would soon return.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

An alchemist from Khaenri'ah, Rhinedottir, known as Gold, gave bodies to many creatures from the Abyss, including the black serpent dragon Durin.

The snow on the top of the mountains never melts, so the forces of eternal ice were able to contain the poison of decay exuding from Durin's body.\nAlthough Durin was defeated, he did not leave behind his love and gratitude for his mother, Rhinedottir, and the world. He was grateful to his mother for giving him wings and a body filled with strength, and he wanted to tell the world about the beautiful place where he was born and grew up with his brothers and sisters.

When they found the Kreideprinz in a camp on Dragonspine, he offered to test a sword with unusual properties. Not long before, the Knights of Favonius arrested a group of Treasure Hoarders near the city and confiscated all their belongings, including the sword. For some time, it gathered dust in a warehouse until Albedo decided to conduct alchemical experiments on it and discovered its history. This ancient magical sword was forged by a blacksmith who disappeared immediately after forging the weapon, and the blade itself was lost for many centuries. The sword was inlaid with Durin's crushed eyes, claws, and scales, and the dragon's venom seeped into the sword, imbuing it with special powers and placing a curse on it. The blacksmith was so proud of his creation that he decided to test the sword himself, but as soon as he entered battle, the energy of decay rushed up the hilt and entered his body. Mere mortals could not resist this power. The cursed and maddened blacksmith fled in a fit of madness and, perhaps after much suffering, met his end in an unknown place. Albedo knew that the Traveler had once cleansed the tears of the Dragon of the East, Dvalin, from corruption, so he offered to test the blade and imbue it with energy in battle."

The purified power of the sword not only revived the plant but also strengthened it, turning it into a Cryo Regisvine. After defeating it, Albedo extracted the sword's life force and felt it resonate with him, as both he and Durin were the creation of the same alchemist, Rhinedottir.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

While patrolling Dragonspine, the Traveler and Paimon discovered surveillance and strange sounds, but when they rushed after the creature, they only found Albedo, who was gathering inspiration for his paintings. When they decided to help the alchemist collect Starsilver for paints, they found his camp destroyed and some of his alchemical research stolen. Following the thief's tracks, they found a cave, and Albedo decided to go in alone, while Traveler and Paimon stayed to guard the exit. After a while, Albedo returned empty-handed, and they heard cries for help. Rushing to help, they saw the lost Adventurer's Guild instructor, Bennett, who was extremely unlucky. As he was heading to the training camp, snow with ice fell on him, and so he was trapped by the Fatui."

        "text": "Dragonspine is, deservedly, the most unique area of Mondstadt. The origins of its name date back to a dragon that fell on the mountain five hundred years ago. Dragonspine is an area covered in snowstorms all year round, exuding a mysterious power. Its mountains are completely covered in snow and ice, and the low temperatures make it impossible to live there. The local grass cannot be set on fire, so the only means you have to warm yourself and avoid frostbite are near the Ruin Braziers, specially installed bonfires, or Warming Seelie. The Subzero Climate of Dragonspine has created Ancient Rime, chunks of ice that cannot be melted with Pyro but instead with Scarlet Quartz. Because of the unique properties Ancient Rime possesses, many expeditions to Dragonspine have come to an abrupt end; the people had no means to get around this odd ice, and in some instances, it blocked entrances and exits. Apart from that, due to Dragonspine's unique Ley Line structure and climate, some gadgets do not work in the area. Many villagers who live at the foot of the mountain liken this monstrous mountain to a blind spot in the eyes of the gods, a place ruled by the inscrutable force of fate. Old Mondstadt fairy tales speak of the mountain as a place of punishment that was abandoned by the Wind of Time and left for the howling winds to sweep in and freeze everything in its moment of destruction. Yet something still stirs here, at the peak of the mountain, and it seems to sing a gentle song, pleasing to the ear, but somehow disturbing to the mind. Despite the harsh climate, avalanches, and monsters, Dragonspine attracts not only the Treasure Hoarders and Fatui who explore the mysterious power of the mountain, but also adventurers who seek treasure. Once, even a small tanuki from Inazuma went to Dragonspine to see the world."

There, the famous adventurer and elder sister of the Guildmaster of Mondstadt, Iris, the scholar Stevens, the founder of the camp and cook Harris, as well as the blacksmith Orban, can be found. Stevens, who studies ancient history, read many historical almanacs while writing his research paper. One of them, compiled before the formation of the Knight of Favonius, spoke of a group of explorers sent by the nobles to explore the Dragonspine, but no details about this group have survived. In the mountains, three diaries written by the servant, Luther, and a man named Eberhart's notes can be found, revealing the deaths of almost all members of the group. Only Eberhart survived, but the Mondstadt archives do not say anything about his return."

In the distant past beyond memory, a certain legend circulated among hunters out in the wild: when the land sealed by ice returns to life and when an uninvited guest disturbs the deep, frozen silence, the lord and leader of the snowboars unto greatness will awaken from slumber, shake off the ice that shackles it, and bring judgment upon those disrespectful interlopers. The huge snowboar is the true master of the Dragonspine, and he cannot be hunted for fun. Snowboars were long thought to have gone extinct hundreds of years ago, but some of them froze in the ice, while others descended the western side of the Dragonspine, passed by the Dawn Winery towards Springvale, and settled in the warm forest."

When he first saw the teeth, no matter how many times he hit them with his hammer, not a crumb came off. So Orban asked the Chief Alchemist of Mondstadt for advice, and the alchemist asked his apprentice, Sucrose, to bring him a Runestone, a relic left to the Knights of Favonius by the Wanderer’s Troupe over a thousand years ago. This relic helped the Mondstadters rebel against the aristocracy. The flautist of this troupe once fought a monster known as the Bakunawa in Mare Jivari, and the Runestone was carved from its body. This relic contains an infinite vitality, similar to that of a dragon, and if Durin's teeth are imbued with this power, they can be forged into a weapon using the Starsilver. Starsilver, a precious ore created by the local geology and patterns of the Ley Lines, can be found throughout Dragonspine. Not only does it make a great weapon, but it can also be used to create potions and special dyes."

One of the adventurers in this group gave the recipe to his friend from the camp, the cook Harris, to recreate it. He had never even heard of many of the ingredients, and some of the cooking methods were new to him, but after some changes, Harris was able to recreate the recipe, which used Chill Meat of snowboars frozen in the ice that remained especially fresh thanks to the low temperature. This same meat inspired a mighty Adeptus from Liyue, Cloud Retainer, to create a dish made from Chill Meat by braising. With the help of the \"supreme cuisine machine,\" a special cooking device designed by the Adeptus, \"Braised Meat\" was created."

This enormous creature fell from a great height, and from its impact with the ground, a gorge was formed. His flesh had long since decomposed, and his corrupted blood had soaked into the ground, poisoning the plants and monsters, but at the same time endowing them with special power. Part of Durin's life force and blood crystallized into Crimson Agates and Scarlet Quartz, which contain a kind of warm energy and can warm from the terrible frost. One day, about five hundred years ago, researchers from Fontaine, Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold, became interested in the body of Elynas, Durin's brother, who died during the Cataclysm. They used the dragon's flesh and blood to awaken the powers of the Abyss in Jakob, and then began to study objects with similar properties, including Scarlet Quartz from Dragonspine and the filth from the Chasm mines. It turned out that they were all similar in composition to Elynas's flesh and had a negative effect on ordinary people. Only Jakob, called a \"Neohuman\" by Rene, was able to resist this destructive influence."

Albedo's assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose, often appear in the camp, helping him with his research. One day, the Kreideprinz discovered a special seed that was not affected by the awakening of life through alchemy. In order to study the seed, the alchemist decided to experiment on the Traveler, who, like the seed, did not belong to the world of Teyvat. After studying the manifestation of elemental energy through fighting Slimes and a special potion made from the Starsilver Catalyst and conducting many different experiments, Albedo found no difference between an ordinary person and the Traveler. But even though the study failed, the simulation of the Traveler's life inspired Albedo, and he was able to momentarily germinate the seed from another world."

She was inspired to become a scientist when she decided to determine the source of the spring water in Springvale, which was the melting snow of the Dragonspine. The ecologist planned to study the climate and other conditions in the mountains, so she bought an expensive set of measuring beacons. While she was installing them, the group was attacked by monsters, and one of the researchers grabbed Esther and took her to a safe place. They refused to return to the mountains, and the beacons were damaged by monsters. With the help of the Traveler, Esther was able to collect the lost beacons and install new ones to collect at least some data. The northern border of the Dragonspine is patrolled by the Knight of Favonius, Riese. Due to the extremely harsh conditions on the mountain, even the most experienced adventurers may not be able to cope with everything that the snowy mountains have in store for them. Riese is tasked with keeping the Mondstadters from going on a trek, but many adventurers are too stubborn and do not give in to persuasion. To this end, the knights have placed several emergency supply points in the mountains so that adventurers in trouble have a better chance of surviving. There is also the adventurer Tommy, who is in love with the bio-alchemist Sucrose, can be met. She instructed him to find the necessary materials, and he happily agreed, not knowing that the order was on Dragonspine. After walking a few steps up the mountain, he got lost and froze."

In reality, these \"Leviathans\" are Moonfin, a rare type of butterflyfish that emits light amidst the pitch-dark ocean. They love to swim in schools, and when gathered together, they form the image of a moon that has fallen into the sea, which is the origin of the \"Lunar Leviathan\" legend. A fisherwoman from Inazuma, Kujirai Momiji, believes that she once encountered the Lunar Leviathan herself. Several years ago, she and some friends from the Fishing Association set out to find the legendary fish, but their journey did not go well. They were caught in a terrible storm, and although the boat survived, the compass broke, and the friends were lost in unfamiliar waters. Several days passed, their fresh water supply ran out, and they still could not find their way home. One night, a fisherman got up, wrote a suicide note, put it in a bottle, threw it into the sea, and was about to jump after it. His friends were awake and managed to drag him back. Then they saw a giant shade under the water, which glowed faintly, shining little by little, as if pieces of the moon were dropped underwater. Out of desperation, the fishermen asked it to return them home safely, and as if by magic, the silhouette swam into the distance and led them to their home. The friends did not stop thinking about the Lunar Leviathan, but one of them found a clue in an ancient book and wrote a bestseller \"Regarding How The Lunar Leviathan Is Actually A Giant Sea Turtle\" and decided that that night, they saw a giant sea turtle with long bioluminescent plants growing on its back. The turtle was pregnant and swimming to the shore to lay her eggs, which is how they found their way. Other old books say that the Lunar Leviathan is a species of ancient creatures from a time when there were many more animals on earth. Their ancestors lived in the area of ​​today's Dragonspine mountains, where their fossils, similar to turtle shells, can still be found.\nIn this subarea, the World Quests The Great Mountain Survey and The Great Mountain Survey II can be found.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

After examining the ruins, Roald noticed that their architectural style bore a striking resemblance to ancient, nameless structures from other regions, but it was impossible to guess what historical period they belonged to. Along the trail, he discovered several thousand-year-old relics whose history dates back to the era of the Mondstadt aristocracy. The adventurer managed to find scraps of clothing and old weapons left over from Eberhart's expedition. As Roald began to climb to the top of the ridge, he encountered severe weather conditions: icicles tore holes in his clothes, his toes were frostbitten, and he nearly broke bones. Although his expedition was unsuccessful, he survived and next set out on a journey through Liyue."

Even when her polearm had been worn beyond use, she still hadn't located her target. Suffering from severe frostbite and carrying wounds from repeated battles with the area's monsters, she had no choice but to leave empty-handed. On the long road back, Escoffier heard rumors of a mysterious Cryo entity known as Daleth, which only served to deepen her sense of regret. Her desire to find this source of Cryo would become a goal exceeded in intensity only by her obsession to advance the culinary arts."

When the man decided to climb to the top, a snowstorm suddenly overtook the peak, and he barely managed to hide in a cave. Suddenly, rocks collapsed, blocking the passage, and the other end of the cave led to a cliff where there was nothing but high snow. Snow foxes lived in the cave with Joserf, and although his supplies were running low, he still shared with them. When the Adventurer's Guild organized an exercise on the Dragonspine, one of the adventurers, Pallad, decided to explore a new, dangerous place. Separated from the group, he slipped and began to roll down the mountain until he found himself in an unfamiliar place with several injuries. There, Pallad met Joserf, who came out at the sound of the fall. At first, Pallad thought he was one of the adventurers who came to the event, but then he realized that the man had memory issues and did not even remember his own name. Joserf said that he woke up covered in blood, and his things were missing, and there was nothing to indicate how he got there. He crawled into the cave and settled in there to gradually recover. And after his legs got a little stronger, his hunting skills helped him survive. Together, they returned to the camp, where they encountered Joel. He froze for a second with a completely stunned expression on his face, and then he started crying out: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Dad! Dad!\"</color> That's when Joserf suddenly started to remember. The only thing the man remembered was his son and wife. In his notes, the man asked to feed the foxes, and if they are fed for five days, they would thank one for their kindness."

They had known each other since they were children, but when Hiromi became an official and Yan'er became a Treasure Hoarder, their paths in life diverged. When the Sakoku Decree was issued in Inazuma and the civil war began, they lost the ability to communicate, so Hiromi could only send a message in a bottle, not knowing which shore the waves would wash up on. When an old friend of theirs came to the officer with news that they had not heard from the woman for a long time, he did not want to believe that she could have died, so he continued to wait for her at the Uyuu Restaurant. Fortunately, Yan'er was safe, and after the Sakoku Decree was lifted, she came to Inazuma, intending to stop by the Uyuu Restaurant for a few drinks."

He hoped that by the time he returned, his daughter would have finished painting the second fresco.

The barriers created by the Primordial One around Teyvat were destroyed, and forbidden knowledge penetrated the land. Besides the destruction, the invaders brought people illusions that could break through the shackles of fate and the Heavenly Principles. The people began to doubt the gods, they disobeyed the heavenly kingdom, tried to ascend to the gods, and began to look for answers in the depths of the world, antediluvian ruins, and long-buried altars of sacrifice. The master of the heavens, consumed by fear for the rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs, to heal this fragile, sad, and imperfect world, sent down the divine nails to mend the land, laying waste to the mortal realm, among which was Sal Vindagnyr."
