Well, I'm heading up a snowy mountain myself, and considering how well everything's gone so far... Who knows? Maybe this book is bringing me good luck. Thank you, Joel.\nAnyway, I shall be heading off to the next campsite to resupply and record my progress, and then I'll head down the mountain. Joel is waiting for me, after all.\nNothing untoward happened on the way here. The weather remains fine indeed. It seems that my luck has turned at last.\nPerhaps I can make a run for the summit after all...\nI'll just give it a little go. If anything happens, I'll turn back right away.\nThe snowstorm from the summit came too quickly. I barely had enough time to duck into this cave. I lost half my supplies in the chaos, too..."

I believe that there's another way out for me. The other end of this cave is a cliff, yes, but there's nothing below but thick snow. If I try climbing a certain distance down and then jumping the rest of the way...\nMy supplies won't last more than a few more days. I have to act soon...\nI promised Joel that I'd take him to see the snow. I won't break that promise.\nOh, yes. If anyone sees these notes, please put some food into that feeding bowl for those foxes.\nThey kept me company the entire time I was trapped in here. If I get the chance, I'd love to bring Joel back here to see them…"
