Dragonspine is an area covered in snowstorms all year round, exuding a mysterious power. Its mountains are completely covered in snow and ice, and the low temperatures make it impossible to live there. The local grass cannot be set on fire, so the only means you have to warm yourself and avoid frostbite are near the Ruin Braziers, specially installed bonfires, or Warming Seelie. The Subzero Climate of Dragonspine has created Ancient Rime, chunks of ice that cannot be melted with Pyro but instead with Scarlet Quartz. Because of the unique properties Ancient Rime possesses, many expeditions to Dragonspine have come to an abrupt end; the people had no means to get around this odd ice, and in some instances, it blocked entrances and exits. Apart from that, due to Dragonspine's unique Ley Line structure and climate, some gadgets do not work in the area. Many villagers who live at the foot of the mountain liken this monstrous mountain to a blind spot in the eyes of the gods, a place ruled by the inscrutable force of fate. Old Mondstadt fairy tales speak of the mountain as a place of punishment that was abandoned by the Wind of Time and left for the howling winds to sweep in and freeze everything in its moment of destruction. Yet something still stirs here, at the peak of the mountain, and it seems to sing a gentle song, pleasing to the ear, but somehow disturbing to the mind. Despite the harsh climate, avalanches, and monsters, Dragonspine attracts not only the Treasure Hoarders and Fatui who explore the mysterious power of the mountain, but also adventurers who seek treasure. Once, even a small tanuki from Inazuma went to Dragonspine to see the world."

Stevens, who studies ancient history, read many historical almanacs while writing his research paper. One of them, compiled before the formation of the Knight of Favonius, spoke of a group of explorers sent by the nobles to explore the Dragonspine, but no details about this group have survived. In the mountains, three diaries written by the servant, Luther, and a man named Eberhart's notes can be found, revealing the deaths of almost all members of the group.

The huge snowboar is the true master of the Dragonspine, and he cannot be hunted for fun. Snowboars were long thought to have gone extinct hundreds of years ago, but some of them froze in the ice, while others descended the western side of the Dragonspine, passed by the Dawn Winery towards Springvale, and settled in the warm forest."

One of the adventurers in this group gave the recipe to his friend from the camp, the cook Harris, to recreate it. He had never even heard of many of the ingredients, and some of the cooking methods were new to him, but after some changes, Harris was able to recreate the recipe, which used Chill Meat of snowboars frozen in the ice that remained especially fresh thanks to the low temperature. This same meat inspired a mighty Adeptus from Liyue, Cloud Retainer, to create a dish made from Chill Meat by braising. With the help of the \"supreme cuisine machine,\" a special cooking device designed by the Adeptus, \"Braised Meat\" was created."

This enormous creature fell from a great height, and from its impact with the ground, a gorge was formed. His flesh had long since decomposed, and his corrupted blood had soaked into the ground, poisoning the plants and monsters, but at the same time endowing them with special power. Part of Durin's life force and blood crystallized into Crimson Agates and Scarlet Quartz, which contain a kind of warm energy and can warm from the terrible frost. One day, about five hundred years ago, researchers from Fontaine, Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold, became interested in the body of Elynas, Durin's brother, who died during the Cataclysm. They used the dragon's flesh and blood to awaken the powers of the Abyss in Jakob, and then began to study objects with similar properties, including Scarlet Quartz from Dragonspine and the filth from the Chasm mines. It turned out that they were all similar in composition to Elynas's flesh and had a negative effect on ordinary people. Only Jakob, called a \"Neohuman\" by Rene, was able to resist this destructive influence."

People believed that it was impossible to challenge the Mare Jivari, and this arrogant young man would surely be swallowed by the flames, turned into ash, and lifted into the sky to disperse into nothingness.

If one collects four dragon fangs and nourishes them with a heart, a blacksmith, Orban, from the Dragonspine camp, can make a special spear of Starsilver, unlike any other weapon. Starsilver, a precious ore created by the local geology and patterns of the Ley Lines, can be found throughout the Dragonspine. Not only does it make a great weapon, but it can also be used to create potions and special dyes."

Like the real Durin, the dragon of the magical world destroyed everything he touched, and people feared him. When he wished never to be born at all, a few heroes from Teyvat appeared in Simulanka and saved the dragon. When Andersdotter was creating Durin of Simulanka, her son, another witch, Barbeloth, made a prophecy about Teyvat's Durin: <color=#ffffffd9>\"R's child... will one day rise from the dead.\"</color> Recent observations at Dragonspine lend credence to this prophecy, and Durin's heart has slowly but surely been growing in vitality. The process is extremely slow, but the trend is clear. Albedo, Durin's brother, hopes that when the time comes, Simulanka's Durin will lend Mondstadt a hand in their hour of need."

Due to his origins, the alchemist is not afraid of the cold of the Dragonspine, and he likes to spend time there researching and drawing. In the Chief Alchemist's camp, an alchemy research table, a workbench, many alchemy books, and a board with the results of experiments can be found. Albedo's assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose, often appear in the camp, helping him with his research. One day, the Kreideprinz discovered a special seed that was not affected by the awakening of life through alchemy. In order to study the seed, the alchemist decided to experiment on the Traveler, who, like the seed, did not belong to the world of Teyvat. After studying the manifestation of elemental energy through fighting Slimes and a special potion made from the Starsilver Catalyst and conducting many different experiments, Albedo found no difference between an ordinary person and the Traveler. But even though the study failed, the simulation of the Traveler's life inspired Albedo, and he was able to momentarily germinate the seed from another world."

She was inspired to become a scientist when she decided to determine the source of the spring water in Springvale, which was the melting snow of the Dragonspine. The ecologist planned to study the climate and other conditions in the mountains, so she bought an expensive set of measuring beacons. While she was installing them, the group was attacked by monsters, and one of the researchers grabbed Esther and took her to a safe place. They refused to return to the mountains, and the beacons were damaged by monsters. With the help of the Traveler, Esther was able to collect the lost beacons and install new ones to collect at least some data. The northern border of the Dragonspine is patrolled by the Knight of Favonius, Riese. Due to the extremely harsh conditions on the mountain, even the most experienced adventurers may not be able to cope with everything that the snowy mountains have in store for them. Riese is tasked with keeping the Mondstadters from going on a trek, but many adventurers are too stubborn and do not give in to persuasion. To this end, the knights have placed several emergency supply points in the mountains so that adventurers in trouble have a better chance of surviving. There is also the adventurer Tommy, who is in love with the bio-alchemist Sucrose, can be met. She instructed him to find the necessary materials, and he happily agreed, not knowing that the order was on Dragonspine. After walking a few steps up the mountain, he got lost and froze."

In reality, these \"Leviathans\" are Moonfin, a rare type of butterflyfish that emits light amidst the pitch-dark ocean. They love to swim in schools, and when gathered together, they form the image of a moon that has fallen into the sea, which is the origin of the \"Lunar Leviathan\" legend. A fisherwoman from Inazuma, Kujirai Momiji, believes that she once encountered the Lunar Leviathan herself. Several years ago, she and some friends from the Fishing Association set out to find the legendary fish, but their journey did not go well. They were caught in a terrible storm, and although the boat survived, the compass broke, and the friends were lost in unfamiliar waters. Several days passed, their fresh water supply ran out, and they still could not find their way home. One night, a fisherman got up, wrote a suicide note, put it in a bottle, threw it into the sea, and was about to jump after it. His friends were awake and managed to drag him back. Then they saw a giant shade under the water, which glowed faintly, shining little by little, as if pieces of the moon were dropped underwater. Out of desperation, the fishermen asked it to return them home safely, and as if by magic, the silhouette swam into the distance and led them to their home. The friends did not stop thinking about the Lunar Leviathan, but one of them found a clue in an ancient book and wrote a bestseller \"Regarding How The Lunar Leviathan Is Actually A Giant Sea Turtle\" and decided that that night, they saw a giant sea turtle with long bioluminescent plants growing on its back. The turtle was pregnant and swimming to the shore to lay her eggs, which is how they found their way. Other old books say that the Lunar Leviathan is a species of ancient creatures from a time when there were many more animals on earth. Their ancestors lived in the area of ​​today's Dragonspine mountains, where their fossils, similar to turtle shells, can still be found.\nIn this subarea, the World Quests The Great Mountain Survey and The Great Mountain Survey II can be found.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The adventurer managed to find scraps of clothing and old weapons left over from Eberhart's expedition. As Roald began to climb to the top of the ridge, he encountered severe weather conditions: icicles tore holes in his clothes, his toes were frostbitten, and he nearly broke bones. Although his expedition was unsuccessful, he survived and next set out on a journey through Liyue."

When the man decided to climb to the top, a snowstorm suddenly overtook the peak, and he barely managed to hide in a cave. Suddenly, rocks collapsed, blocking the passage, and the other end of the cave led to a cliff where there was nothing but high snow. Snow foxes lived in the cave with Joserf, and although his supplies were running low, he still shared with them. When the Adventurer's Guild organized an exercise on the Dragonspine, one of the adventurers, Pallad, decided to explore a new, dangerous place. Separated from the group, he slipped and began to roll down the mountain until he found himself in an unfamiliar place with several injuries. There, Pallad met Joserf, who came out at the sound of the fall. At first, Pallad thought he was one of the adventurers who came to the event, but then he realized that the man had memory issues and did not even remember his own name. Joserf said that he woke up covered in blood, and his things were missing, and there was nothing to indicate how he got there. He crawled into the cave and settled in there to gradually recover. And after his legs got a little stronger, his hunting skills helped him survive. Together, they returned to the camp, where they encountered Joel. He froze for a second with a completely stunned expression on his face, and then he started crying out: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Dad! Dad!\"</color> That's when Joserf suddenly started to remember. The only thing the man remembered was his son and wife. In his notes, the man asked to feed the foxes, and if they are fed for five days, they would thank one for their kindness."
