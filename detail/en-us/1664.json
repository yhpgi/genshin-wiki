Only sincerity and fire could melt such evil ice. Ack-ack-ack!\" The fox replied.\n\"Friendship demands sacrifice. No friendships come without sacrifices. I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds,\" the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle said.\nThe clever Boar Princess knew right away what she had to do. She dried her tears and curtsied to the two wise animals:\n\"Oink oink! Thank you! I would like for you to come and see the pup with me, so that you can be the first to witness our friendship!\"\nWhen the fox and the turtle heard the Boar Princess was willing to invite them on a royal trip, their hearts were filled with joy. They set out with the Princess and headed north.\n(A handwritten note, seemingly from the young girl's father, is taped to the page: \"Turtles can't make noises, no matter how hard they try. The reason Grandpa Turtle apologizes for this is just because he is very polite.\")"
