One day, the first throne of eternity, the first\nappeared in the heavens. The\ndeclared war on the elemental dragons, and after forty years of battle, the seven sovereigns were defeated, and the seven nations submitted to the heavens. Heavenly Principles stole the power of the defeated Sovereigns, used it to create divine thrones, and established the cycle of seven. Now, everyone who becomes an Archon ascends to the divine throne and receives the Gnosis. As long as the divine thrones exist, the cycle of seven will continue, and the elemental dragons will not be able to gain their full authority.\nDuring the war of vengeance (probably the ancient battle between the Descenders and the dragons) the Primordial One was wounded and lost some of their functions, so they could no longer use their absolute authority to suppress the original order of this world. To continue to subdue and control the resentments and loathing of the world, the Heavenly Principles, together with one who came after, created the Gnoses from the remains of the third Descender. So it came to be that an order was made to be upheld, and thus did humans come to only possess these seven remembrances, and all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other. Some believe these remains bring misfortune with them, since as soon as a person dies, all their previous connections with this world become curses. After the creation of the Gnoses, Celestia declared the Archon War, a war between the gods of Teyvat for the right to ascend to the divine throne and obtain a Gnosis. Only one deity from each region could become an Archon, while all others had to abdicate the throne or be defeated."

This artifact is the core that contains a huge amount of elemental power, which the Archons can use at their discretion. There are seven Gnoses, one for each element and region. As the Gnosis is the Archons' direct link to Celestia, it is believed that destroying the artifact can awaken the Heavenly Principles, which have been dormant for about 500 years since the Cataclysm.\nWhile the Archons use the Gnoses, many other beings use Visions, magical foci that allow them to use elemental energy. Although many believe that the Archons give out the Visions, they are not directly involved in this process. Whenever a person's wish reaches the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm are duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish steps into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still have to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. When one so gifted completes their duty, the gift the gods receive in return is still more abundant.\nThe organization from Snezhnaya, the Fatui, subordinate to the Cryo Archon, the Tsaritsa, collects the Gnoses for their Archon. The exact purpose of using the Gnoses is currently unknown, but it may be related to Fatui's plan to overthrow the Heavenly Principles.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Focalors pondered for a long time how to counter the prophecy and fate, and found only one possible answer: it was necessary to deceive the Heavenly Principles during the fulfillment of the prophecy. She separated her newfound divinity from her body and spirit. She named her human counterpart Furina and charged her with taking on the role of Archon and ruling Fontaine. Focalors placed her divinity, along with the Hydro Gnosis, inside the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, a special device that converted the people's faith in justice into Indemnitium, a type of energy that powers Fontaine. Although the device was used for judgment, its main purpose was to kill the Hydro Archon and destroy the divine throne when the time came. Focalors knew that only with such a power could she hope to destroy the Archon's divine throne, undermine Celestia's rule, and crush the rules of the Seven. As the prophecy began to come true, Focalors set her plan into motion, and the Oratrice destroyed both Focalors and Fontaine's divine throne, returning the power it held to the Hydro Dragon Neuvillette.\nLike all Harbingers,\nwas tasked with delivering the Hydro Gnosis to Snezhnaya and was allowed to use it to save Fontaine from the prophecy. For a long time, the Harbinger tried to find out the location of the artifact, realizing that Furina did not have it. She even sent children from the House of Hearth to infiltrate the Fortress of Meropide to find out what secret the prison hides and whether it relates to the Gnosis. With the Hydro divine throne destroyed, a new Hydro Archon could no longer emerge. The Hydro Sovereign, having regained his full authority, forgave the Fontainians for their original sin and took over Fontaine himself, granting his power to those whose will could reach the heavens. Since the Hydro Dragon had no need for the power of the Gnosis, Neuvillette gave the Hydro Gnosis to Arlecchino, as a sign of gratitude for the assistance with the disaster in Fontaine.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

After ascending to the divine throne, he borrowed the powers of the Ruler of Death, Ronova, one of the shades of the Primordial One, and established the rules of Natlan â€” a framework through which ordinary people can ascend to archonhood. These rules are the Ode of Resurrection, which allows bearers of the Ancient Name who fell in battle with the Abyss to be resurrected, and the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. During the Pilgrimage, the Natlanese determine the strongest of them who can become the next Pyro Archon, and create contending fire to fuel the Sacred Flame. When a person ascends to the divine throne, their inner flame awakens, and the Sacred Flame of Natlan grants significant knowledge and memories of this land. The power received by a new Archon depends on the potential of the person. The same principle applies to the power of the Ruler of Death, but the amount of inherited power does not change depending on the ability to withstand it. If a person withstands the test, they will gain unprecedented power and the ability to use powers greater than the powers of any Archon. But any power has a price, and the price for Ronova's power is death. Although this rule does not define the time of the payment, the outcome is still inevitable."

Initially, they suffered during the war of the dragons and the first Descender and were later corrupted by the Abyss and began to decay during the Cataclysm 500 years ago. One of the angels, under the guidance of the Ruler of Death, created the Night Kingdom, which replaces the Ley Lines of Natlan and where rules are laid down. Due to the state of Ley Lines after the Cataclysm and the constant attacks of the Abyss, according to calculations, the region could not exist for more than 500 years. Pyro Archon Mavuika devised a plan to use the power of the divine throne and Ronova's power to save Natlan. A hero would emerge from each tribe, and when all six heroes gathered together, Ronova's power would be unleashed. In order to carry out such a risky plan herself, Mavuika gave her life so that she could be reborn when Natlan's time was running out."

Although Mavuika knew that she would have to pay with her life for Ronova's power and that her plan could fail, she didn't want to use Pyro Gnosis to destroy all souls and cleanse the corruption. The Pyro Gnosis has the ability to take people's souls and memories from Ley Lines to weave them into a giant net that can contain the corruption of the Abyss. In the process of creating this web, all souls would be destroyed, so Mavuika was hesitant to use this function. Even if the entire memory of the region had been sacrificed, the net could still suffer from corruption, and all the sacrifices would be in vain. With the power of the divine throne and Ronova's power, Mavuika was able to stop a full-scale Abyss invasion of Natlan, partially cleanse the Night Kingdom of the Abyss corruption, and use the Ode of Resurrection on all the people of Natlan who died after receiving the power.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
