Which tribe were they from?\nAsk the pale light of three moons, and still you shall have no answer.\nStory and song say Sundjatta was born blessed by the stars of dawn.\nNo beauty his mother, no strongman his father,\nBut the celestial watcher-stars care not for mortal appearance,\nFor to weave the fate of heaven and earth alone is duty eternal, a task divine.\nMbande was chief of our tribe when Sundjatta was young,\nBlack-Jade Mbande, who was the mother of mines and gems,\nT'was she who chose him to be our tribe's hero.\nAnd thus did his story begin, the hero great, the miner mighty.\nWhen young Sundjatta began his career in the mines,\nThe mountain-carving hammers were larger than his whole body.\nYet he wielded them as though he were the wind itself,\nSo much so that heroes cried out, \"The mine! It's about to collapse!\"\n\"Haha! Brothers, sisters, do not be afraid!\"\n\"'Tis merely my hammer summoning up a gale. See? A whoop, and a whoosh!\"\nThus did he swing on, chiseling into the great mountain, sparks flying from the hammer's handle,\nAnd they all looked on in joy and fear, as the champion's laurels he claimed!\nWhen Lady Mbande returned to the Lord of the Night's embrace,\nSundjatta was already a young man, robust beyond his years.\nOn the night when a chief was to be elected, he left the tribe alone,\nTribal champion though he was, Sundjatta aspired not to power,\nBut instead sought to find a proud testament to his existence as one of us,\nResolute was he, striking out on an adventure toward lands distant and foreign,\nYet his passion was misunderstood by his tribespeople, who regarded him as a runaway, a traitor..."
