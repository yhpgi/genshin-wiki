Despite the lack of supporting evidence, Seymour is thought to be the first thinking machine that Alain ever made. Seymour's creation was inspired by Alain's assistant and friend, Carter Scherbius, who proposed to create a thinking Kamera. He believed that Alain would regret those moments when he was not with his sister Mary-Ann and would want to see how she grew up and changed. Alain did not initially approve of the idea, but he still saw the benefit of such a development for the Maison Gardiennage."

Elynas appeared in Fontaine during the Cataclysm 500 years ago and could have destroyed the whole region. When Alain Guillotin found out about the upcoming ritual, he sent Seymour to inform the Iudex of Fontaine Neuvillette about it. A battle between the Marechaussee Hunters, including Mary-Ann Guillotin and Seymour, and the Narzissenkreuz Ordo occurred inside Elynas's body. During the battle, an explosion killed many agents of the Marechaussee Phantom and their Meks. Due to the explosion, Seymour was significantly damaged and went into hibernation mode.\nFrom the wounds Elynas received from the explosion, new creatures called Melusines were born. Each Melusine was born with a shard of broken Meks, so they began to consider these objects as their \"tokens\" that must be protected. Seymour’s artificed clockwork relay module was obtained by Melusine Mamere, an artist who later found Seymour among the wreckage, repaired it, and became its friend.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

During the clash, Seymour was damaged, and the Traveler and Paimon went to collect special parts to repair Seymour. Under the instructions of her Father, Elynas, whom only Mamere could hear, she restored Seymour's work, and he came out of hibernation. After waking up, he remembered his main goal: to accompany his master, Mary-Ann, and ensure she would smile happily. Due to memory damage, he did not remember where Mary-Ann was, so he said goodbye to Mamere and went to look for his master.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
