She hopes that's okay.\nShe may look like a zombie, but she's surprisingly limber due to a strict calisthenics regimen.\nHer memory is poor. She forgets easily, and that is partly why she can seem cold to others.\nHer appearance is forever frozen at the point of her passing, so estimates of her age are unreliable.\nZombies require orders to act, but due to some reason or another, Qiqi is presently giving herself orders."

Whenever she meets Qiqi, she will say: \"It would be easier if you just let me bury you.\"\nQiqi, of course, has no wish to be buried, and so conducts her exercises at night when no one's about.\nQiqi's memory falls far behind those of non-undead disposition.\nIf she does not continue to reinforce her impressions of someone, she will completely forget them in three days tops.\nBut who knows, this might be a good thing — for a person with painful memories, forgetting may, in fact, be a form of release.\nThe person Qiqi must remember most... not only does this person have a very punch-able face, but she also shows up every single day.\nAs such, Qiqi isn't too concerned about her poor memory."

But strictly speaking, Qiqi has never been awakened.\nAs such, she counts as a very rare case of a zombie that gives itself orders.\nIf these orders are simple ones like \"defeat the enemy,\" Qiqi has no problem fulfilling them.\nBut when faced with complex instructions such as \"go to Jueyun Karst, climb the sheer rock faces and pick herbs,\" Qiqi sometimes winds up stuck below the cliffs, unable to give up no matter how many times she tries and fails to scale the cliff.\nThe method to cancel her orders is very simple — hug Qiqi from behind, tell her something like \"I love you the most,\" and the orders will dissipate, just like that.\nUnfortunately, there's just no element of sincerity when Baizhu does it, leading to greatly reduced results.\nPerhaps someday, someone will come along who understands that such words cannot be spoken lightly, and who slowly but carefully releases the hold that Qiqi's orders have over her...\nWhat will Qiqi's response be then?"

Injuring her right leg in a fall, she hurriedly hid in a cavern to rest.\nEven occupied as she was in bandaging her wound, she could hear sounds that did not belong to the mortal plane. But she could have never expected that with a huge crash, she would forever be trapped between life and death.\nWhether adepti or demons, just or wicked, all understood that she was an innocent mortal caught in the crossfire.\nOr perhaps it was by the will of heaven that she received a Vision in her dying moments, and so ended this contention between adepti and demon.\nThe adepti could not bear to let her die, and each imparted to her a portion of their strength, meaning to breathe life back into her body.\nQiqi did indeed awaken and live again, but went into a berserk state, unable to control the adepti energy raging through her.\nSeeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper had no choice but to seal the hapless maiden in amber."

Coupled with the passing of many years, the seal on Qiqi was all but spent.\nShe awakened in the middle of the night, broke the amber in secret, and fled.\nFollowing the herb-picking habits of her previous life, Qiqi headed right for the hills.\nBy chance, she met Baizhu, the boss of Bubu Pharmacy, on the way, and he took her in.\nNow, Baizhu was a doctor of great skill, but he was hardly a man of high caliber or great courage.\nEven so, he took her in, never mind that her memory was so poor that she could not even sort herbs out.\nIt does seem that his acceptance of Qiqi has something to do with his own personal pursuits.\nQiqi is stiff, but not slow, and has long realized this. However, she does not take it to heart.\nPerhaps she has seen too much, or been alone for too long... But what remains true is that she treasures his concern, even if there is some other motive behind it."
