If they think you'll let them do things as they please down here, then they've got another think coming!</color>\nQuest Objective: Go to the campsite that has been occupied by Treasure Hoarders\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Those Treasure Hoarders have imprisoned someone. Is this human trafficking?\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Paimon thinks you're overestimating their courage...\nQuest Objective: Clear out the Treasure Hoarders in the miner's camp\n<color=#ffffff>Erge:</color> What, you're only here now? ...Wait, brothers! The hard-hats are here!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> What hats!?\n<color=#ffffff>Erge:</color> Darn it! Come on, we're getting out of here!\nQuest Objective: Save the person trapped in a cage by the Treasure Hoarders\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color> Help! Help me! I'm here!\nQuest Objective: Talk to Clitopho\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Phew! Thank you for saving my life...\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Wait a moment... I remember you! You're that Toclipho guy from back at the mine!\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Uh, what? No! That wasn't... I—I don't sell any fake medicines! I'm Clitopho, yes, but not the one that's into pharmaceuticals. No sir!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Huh. So the medicines you sold were fake?\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> What? No! Impossible! The medicines I sell are one-hundred-percent the real deal! I mean, you saw the miners! They drank it, and they felt great!\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> And didn't you say you were the non-pharmaceutical Clitopho?\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Ah, uh... Right, that was after my life selling medicines ended. And it all ended when that... when that Toclipho sold fakes under a false identity!\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> He sold fake medicines under a false name and ruined my reputation! That's right. That's why I swore off selling medicines forever!\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> And just as I was changing tacks, I was captured by that band of Treasure Hoarders...\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> But yes, that charlatan is truly despicable...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Yup, he's a real piece of work, to want to trick those in the same business as him like that!\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> And so, what was the false name of this \"Toclipho\" again?\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Clitopho!\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Uh. No, wait. Clitopho isn't a fake name. It's a real one...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Doesn't that make \"Toclipho\" a fake name?\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> No... Wait, yes. Yes. He took my name falsely, so \"Clitopho\" is now a false name. We're clear now, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Ooh... So \"Toclipho\" became a real name.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> What a shame...\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> What's a shame?\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> You nearly confessed without us having to try too hard.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Let's take him back up. The Millelith have a lot of questions for him, most likely.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Or we could deal with him right here and now.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> What?\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Hey! This isn't the time for such jokes.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Hehe, hehehe. Paimon thinks it's pretty funny.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> B—But you're not laughing. And no, this isn't funny at all!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: You're right, actually — because we're about to get serious.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> W—Wait a moment! This isn't the time for an interrogation!\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> I don't know about you, but carrying a Treasure Hoarder you scared half to death around doesn't appeal to me one bit. Either way, let's take him back to the camp first.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: You make a good point.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Hey, hey, hey! Take me along, would you? I'll be very useful to you! I mean, as you can see... I've been kicked out of the Treasure Hoarders...\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> So now I'm an upstanding citizen again, y'know?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Oh, so that's what counts for \"upstanding citizen\" to you, huh...\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> And what are your skills, again?\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> I can... make explosives?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Not fake medicine?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> No, no, he said \"explosives.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> And your explosives aren't fake, either?\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> No, they're for real this time!\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> ...\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> ...I'm not at liberty to include you on the team. As for how we should deal with you, Jinwu would be a better judge of that. But I guess she'll just hand you over to the Millelith.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> But we'll keep an eye on you. All Treasure Hoarders are not to be trusted, let alone someone who sells fake medicine...\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Oh come on, I don't do that anymore!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Oh, we know, we know! Let's go, shall we?\nQuest Objective: Go to the second occupied camp\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Ever since the Array was broken, many secret-smuggler's tunnels were also unsealed... That's probably how they got in.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> These guys are most likely involved in ore smuggling rings back in Liyue. It'd be a service to get rid of them.\nGo to the second occupied camp\n<color=#ffffff>Erge:</color> Ugh, why is it you again!? And you let Clitopho out, too?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> That's Paimon's line!\n<color=#ffffff>Erge:</color> Let's get out of here... This deal is off!\nQuest Objective: Clear the Treasure Hoarders from the miner's camp\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Eh? There's a huge cannon here. Let's go have a look at it, shall we?\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> That's the Mountainator that we miners used... Well, and that's just what the miners called it.\nQuest Objective: Examine the giant cannon in the depths of the tunnels\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> The locking mechanism hasn't rusted away yet. In fact, it looks like it's been lubricated. Looks like someone maintained it even after the mine was sealed.\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> The breech also looks whole... It's just that the safety is currently locked down.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> What is he talking about?\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> The tunnels ahead were sealed using large rocks when the miners were dispersed... Looks like that's where we're going to need to use this cannon again.\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> But without any shot, cannons, no matter how large, are useless. As such, we need to find ourselves some.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Hmph, don't say it like I didn't know that, Mr. Know-It-All.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> There's a store room nearby that should contain the cannon-shot. With any luck, not all of it was moved away when the miners were dismissed...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Let's head that way, then.\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Let's go.\nQuest Objective: Go to the storehouse in which the cannonballs are stored\nQuest Objective: Talk to Zhiqiong\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> This is the place. *cough* Ugh, the gate's locked.\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Looks like we'll need to use two keys at once to open the door... Oh come on, why are you Liyue people so conscientious about the silliest things?\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Oh, cut the useless chatter... See that notice pasted next to the gate? If nothing else, that tells us that our cannonballs can be found within.\n<color=#ffffff>Clitopho:</color> Well, that's one thing, but how do we know if the fuses have been well-preserved or not? I wouldn't get our hopes up just yet.\n<color=#ffffff>Zhiqiong:</color> Oh, great — we have an optimist over here.
