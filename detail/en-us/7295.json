People who had given up on fighting the Abyss decided to try their luck and go in search of the Jade, even if it was a trap. When Natlan was overrun by corruption, an evil dragon appeared in the Cinder City. All the adventurers who went in hopes of destroying the Abyss were defeated by the dragon, and almost none of them returned. Among these adventurers was a group that set out for the city in the clouds ten years after the Cataclysm. The group's leader was the most powerful warrior of the Flower-Feather Clan, Taika. Before the Cataclysm, he had always won in combat duels and was bored, thinking that his whole life would pass like this. It was only after witnessing true war that he first felt the weight of destiny. Thus did he bid his wife and unborn child farewell and set out to drive the evil spirits away. In the city, he discovered the blueprints of Ochkanatlan, thanks to which the group was able to find the Altar of Primal Fire and reach the flying ship. But the battle on the Tonatiuh was his last, and before his death, he remembered the words he said to his he said to his beloved wife as they parted."

Someone had taken it from the skyship and given it to all the adventurers before Bona.
