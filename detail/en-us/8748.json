Even the stars look upon you in awe.\nO indestructible Lord, please quiet this earth-shaking wrath.\nLift the torment that occupies my heart and cast out this pitch-black disaster.\n(Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This is an ancient form of the prayer once used to quell the fury of nature. Though records whisper of a lost variant, its final four lines meant to summon, rather than quell, natural disasters, it vanished from memory long before the birth of the Moon Maiden, for reasons unknown. The Moonchanter Aila, first to hold the title, later revised and simplified this prayer. Her version, presented below, is now recognized as the standard for all recitations:\nO pale white Frost Moon, in the name of the descendants of the far north, I beseech you to appease this earth-shaking wrath.\nMay your gentle light soothe the lingering pain that occupies our hearts, and cast out that pitch-black disaster!)\n...\nPrayer Song XI: The Goddess of the Dawnstar and Apostle of the Far North - Koitar and Seutervoinen\nI call upon Koitar, wife of Seutervoinen and first, fairest daughter of the creator god,\nO generous maiden and bright morning star, your deeds are forever praised in music by the descendants of the far north.\nThe cold wind of night cannot extinguish the silver flame within our chests, nor can its perilous darkness corrupt our hearts.\nOne day, we shall return home, through the wild grasses of the lonely graveyards to the majestic golden city.\nI call upon you, Koitar truly-blessed, to cast your favor upon our conquests, even as you once subdued all nations with your might.\nI call upon you to shake the earth, to make the cities tremble, and to let the enemies of the far north vanish like dew beneath the Frost Moon.\n(Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This prayer is an older form, preserved from a time long past. It was later significantly revised by Aila, the first Moonchanter. The following text is now recognized as the standard for all recitations:\nThe icy winds cannot extinguish the silver flame within our chests, nor shall the evil nights corrupt our hearts.\nO pale white Frost Moon, protect the descendants of the far north, and let the pitch-black disasters of the cold night melt away like the morning dew.\n...\nPrayer Song XVI: Saarelainen, The Stranger of Winter's Day\nO, let not the death-pangs you suffered pass into me, lover of frost and winter.\nYou cheerful, fair, kind-hearted lad, noble-born and nobly raised, a gentle and valiant son.\nUpon the starry steed, you rode across the forsaken isle of Hiisi and the dark, mist-shrouded lands of Pohjola,\nThere to court the daughter of Pakkaisukko, that peerless beauty, at her home.\nThen old Pakkaisukko, servant of our forebears, answered thus:\nHe will grant the young lady's hand in marriage if you should open for him the gates of Pohjola.\nCheerful, fair, kind-hearted one, you knew well that wicked scheme, yet you went forth freely.\nFor were you not to go, old Pakkaisukko would have his gullible daughter suffer the punishment instead.\nIn dark and foggy Pohjola, the Lord of the Seven Calamities carved you into seven pieces.\nAnd that young and pure girl, the daughter of Pakkaisukko, shall never again be wed.\nO lost hero, I call upon you by your unspeakable name, you the healer of the world's sorrows and misfortunes,\nAnd may your grace still the wild winds of the frigid night and bring warmth to the young birds huddled on the frozen earth.\n(Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This is an old version of a prayer for wound healing and the curing of disease that was later revised and simplified by the first Moonchanter, Aila. The following text is now recognized as the standard for all recitations:\nO lost child, in the name of the descendants of the far north, I pray for the blessing of light.\nMay the Frost Moon's grace still the wild winds of the cold night and bring warmth to the young birds huddled on the frozen earth.)"
