You aren't seriously thinking of taking on that... Uh, whatever it is, without me, are you?\"\n\"Listen up, you lot! I am Yupanqui, and it is I that is destined to shake the very foundations of the... Wait, I haven't finished!\"\nMany years later, whenever he thought back upon that journey, he couldn't help laughing at how awkwardly childish he used to be.\nMore than once did his failure to heed advice land him in great danger; more than once did his boisterousness earn him the quiet artisan's annoyance.\nThough it is true that countless enemies fell to the swings of his greatsword, on balance, his contributions were still outweighed by the trouble he caused.\nDespite this, the companions who journeyed by the warrior's side tolerated his youthful ignorance.\nWhen his vision was taken by the fire of delirium, it seemed to him that he heard the silent priest's words once more...\n\"One day, you will understand why you embarked on this verdant path.\"\n\"By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on.\"\n\"We will answer to the fire for all our deeds.
