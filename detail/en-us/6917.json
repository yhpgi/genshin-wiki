It was fascinated by the songs of the Monetoo, and in secret was even given to observing human behavior.\nIts name was Maawe, which in an ancient, long-forgotten language, meant \"bit of string.\"\nYoung Maawe had not lived through the ancient wars and could not understand the \"virtues\" of dragonkind.\nAs far as it was concerned, nothing was more pleasing than cool moonlit nights and the warm shadows of red cliffs.\n\"Such blatant indolence! How can this be tolerated in the Dragonlord's Palace? The puerile whelp must rediscover the ambition and fury of its noble heritage.\"\nThus spake the dragon matriarch, decreeing that the young Maawe must leave the tribe to grow up like a \"real dragon\"â€”\nTo harden its heart, to become as tenaciously proud as obsidian, and to be guided alone by cruel, lofty ambition..."
