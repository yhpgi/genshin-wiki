Judging by the reaction of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning for the hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous in mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly exists among the hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study.\nThe fifth song:\nNini movo muhe yoyo\nNini movo mimi tomo\nLata movo mosi yoyo\nCeli movo celi yoyo\nMuch like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of praise to the Anemo Archon. This is a hilichurl ode that is often heard when they are inebriated.\nThe sixth song:\nUnu, unu\nYaya ika kundala!\nUnu, unu\nMita dada ya dala?\nUnu, unu\nKuzi mita dada ye\nMita dada-a-mimi\nA pious ode that is only sung by hilichurls during sacrifices. When performing this ode, the hilichurls often add percussion by beating the backsides of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating rhythmic ringing sounds. It must be quite painful.\nThe seventh song:\nMimi movo\nMimi sada\nMimi domu\nDomu upa\nGusha dada\nIt appears that many hilichurl tribes share a tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song is one such bonfire ballad sung by the chief at the end of the night. At the end of the song, the chief shouts \"nunu\" three times, which presumably carries the meaning of \"sleep.\""
