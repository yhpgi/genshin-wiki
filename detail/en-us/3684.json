It contains Marvelous Jellies much loved by the Fungi, and the Jellies themselves come in many unique flavors that can be fed to the Fungi based on their individual preferences.<br>The Marvelous Jellies are a refined version of the Floral Jellies that preceded them and retain their crystalline translucence and springy texture, sans the dangerous ingredients, thus making them the ideal feed for Fungi. that said, one should probably take care that the children don't eat it by mistake when storing it at home...</p>",
