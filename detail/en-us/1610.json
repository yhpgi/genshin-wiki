I should have known not to trust this old mining crew, it must have been several decades since the last of them retired! Every last bit of information they gave me is completely out of date... utterly useless. This is turning into a complete farce. I would say I'll be going home empty-handed tonight, but the chances of me finding my way home at all in this fog are looking slim... I hope Dongdong's eaten dinner.\nI can hear hilichurls somewhere in the distance. I have no idea where I'm going in this fog, so I suppose I'll just focus on walking away from the hilichurls' voices. Hopefully I'll make it out alive...\nI don't know how long I've been walking, and in this fog I don't even know if it's daytime or nighttime. Hang on, are those silhouettes I see up ahead? By the good grace of the Geo Lord, maybe I can join along with them and find a way out of here. Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. Hooray, I'm saved!\nOn closer inspection, the silhouettes didn't look like friendly characters. I've decided to set up a camp here and wait for them to leave before figuring out my next move. I might have to go back the way I came.\nEgads! I can hear hilichurls all around me... I should definitely—\n-End of diary content-"
