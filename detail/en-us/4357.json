This effect only works in Liyue.<br/><br/>A long rod that stands like elegant bamboo. It is said to have been constructed and kept by a skilled hermit from Liyue, and it was first discovered on a stone tablet with the following words carved upon it: \"O you who aspire, take up this rod,\" like a legendary sword waiting for a hero to pull it out. Of course, you only ever hear this glorious origin story from the mouths of merchants, so it may just be some rhetoric used to increase the item's value... But those who know this and still use this rod can only be those who are ready and willing to accept this pact.",

When the device first came out, it was most warmly received by the Association members, and now it has gradually been promoted in other regions.</p><p>It is an exceptionally hot commodity in the Snezhnayan market.
