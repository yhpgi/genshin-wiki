You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?"

I have some good stuff you'll need there.\"\n\"The rainforest is terribly infested with poisonous snakes, ferocious monsters, and a terminal case of humidity — it's no place for the less-than-thoroughly prepared, no sir! Now then, why don't you try bringing this for your trip? Buy it now and enjoy a 20 percent discount!\"\n\"Hold your horses, hotshot. You're not taking that route, are you? There's a huge pack of monsters lying in wait ahead that-a-ways. But see, I have some weapons here that you won't regret purchasing — you know, for self-defense!\"\n\"Going to the Akhtamun Ruins? You've got the right person. First things first, you'll need a complete set of water-drawing tools... Which, as it happens, I happen to have for sale!\"\nThere is a tale among adventurers in Sumeru.\nIt says that if you are about to embark on a journey into a dangerous place, you'll see a diminutive figure, seemingly having been waiting for you.\nBe it in the treacherous mountains, arid deserts, grim rainforests, or desolate areas inhabited by monsters, you'll always see her smiling face.\nWord has it that Dori carries all manner of marvelous items on her person all the time. Her items can help adventurers get through their pressing troubles.\n—At a \"reasonable\" price, of course.\nAdventurers who \"have just received Dori's help in their time of need\" at the cost of \"paying a large sum of Mora at once\" often develop conflicted feelings toward her — somewhere in between gratitude and a grudge.\nFor Dori's part, she considerately ignores the conflicted look on their faces, putting the fresh Mora in her almost-bursting purse and bidding them adieu with a contented smile.\n\"Thank you for your generous purchase. Hehe.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 3</color>\nFrom the perspective of others, Dori's business has always been on the up and up. However, only Dori herself knows how many unimaginable bottlenecks she's struggled through.\nThere was a time when orders from all over Sumeru just kept flooding in and Dori couldn't deliver such a giant number of orders in a timely fashion.\nUnfortunately, the capacity of the usual merchant routes was too limited for the delivery of commodities in such a gigantic quantity.\nMany members of Dori's merchant caravans suggested rejecting certain orders to dial down the scale of delivery and maintain a decent, stable profit — one that already seemed set to make them immensely wealthy, given time.\nBut Dori took a very bold step: She accepted all the orders while starting cooperation with the Kshahrewar to establish new trade routes in areas that were known to be dangerous.\nShe opened the new routes up to nearby merchant caravans, took the opportunity to found a commerce guild and put the relevant resources to good use, and finally eliminated the bottleneck that her business was stuck in.\nToday, Dori's new, built-from-scratch merchant routes are seen all across Sumeru, and the good reputation of \"Lord Sangemah Bay\" has spread far and wide. The words Dori said to her caravan members have also become common knowledge\" I'm not some stupid toadstool. I don't cancel or reject any orders.\"Every Mora that can be earned, will be earned by me. Why? Well, because it's there, of course.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4</color>\nDori used to suffer terribly from insomnia. Back then, she would often lose sleep for no reason. After such sleepless nights, she would show up to trade meetings with a pair of raccoon eyes.\nEven the best doctors couldn't diagnose her properly. She burned one frankincense stick after another, and yet they did not lull her into sleep but into coughing fits instead.\nIt was at that moment that a doctor passed by and told Dori this:\n\"I've heard that some people place an hourglass by their bedside. The sound of the falling sand helps them sleep.\"\nDori tried it for a few days and it didn't work. However, she was inspired by the failed attempt, ordering a large custom-made hourglass.\nThat which was in this hourglass was not sand, but shiny Mora.\nThat night, embraced by the music of jingling Mora, Dori slept soundly at last.\nAfter that, Dori learned the trick to dealing with insomnia:\n\"To sleep well, you must first secure peace of mind.\""

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 5</color>\nMaybe it's because of her deep love for Mora, Dori also takes interest in \"whoever or whatever might bring Mora in.\"\nFor example, her merchant caravans use Sumpter Beasts to carry cargo, so Dori had an \"amusement park\" built for the Sumpter Beasts such that they might enjoy their downtime.\nShe also handpicks Sumpter Beast food of the best quality to make sure that they have balanced nutrition and that they stay in good health.\nAlso, as a shrewd merchant, she never misses a single business opportunity.\nSumpter Beasts playing together in the amusement park make for a fun scene, so Dori took the chance to open the amusement park to tourists and sold tickets, food, and souvenirs to them. The cost of raising the Sumpter Beasts was covered by the amusement park's revenue in no time.\nDori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.\nPerhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.\nDori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.\nSometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed —\nFor the one who dwells in the lamp is a powerful fighter, while the one holding the lamp is the one who grants wishes."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 6</color>\nNo one knows how exactly Dori met Alice, but they are truly a pair of business partners that could make all merchants jealous.\nAlice travels the world, so she does not stay for long every time she visits Sumeru. However, every once in a while, Alice will ask someone to send her new invention to Dori.\nDori, for her part, will sell it and find a way to send the Mora to Alice.\nSometimes, Alice sends the invention with an attached letter that tells Dori to keep the Mora for the time being because Alice is currently in a dangerous area.\nHowever, Dori insists on getting someone to send the Mora to safe zones closest to Alice's position, making sure that Alice will receive the Mora at her earliest convenience.\nThe labor, shipment, insurance... The various costs tend to amount to a fairly large expenditure, but Dori is never stingy in this regard. She even pays in advance.\n\"I, Dori, never default on payment.\"\n\"Also, Ms. Alice has expenses, too. I must make sure that she has Mora at hand whenever she needs it.\"\nDori often repeats these words and, despite the trouble, repeatedly makes sure that Alice's payment is delivered.\nThough Alice is no longer Dori's only supplier, Alice's payment is still a top priority for Dori.\nPerhaps it's because Dori keeps a certain promise embedded in her heart — the promise she made to Alice the day they met.\n\"You want limitless Mora? Sure. I can supply you with marvelous items of all kinds. But how much Mora you're going to make will depend on how good you are at sales.\"\n\"Don't worry. I'll sell them for a good price, earn a large sum of Mora, and deliver your share as quickly as possible... I'll be your greatest business partner.\""

They spent their innocent childhood hand-in-hand as constant companions.\nThey each picked flowers to decorate the other's hair in spring and walked across creeks barefoot in summer.\nThey slid down the golden sand dunes in autumn and shared a book in the warmth of the winter sunlight.\nIt seemed that such happy times would never come to an end.\nThat is, until the elder sister started coughing blood for no reason. At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.\nThe strangers explained the elder sister's situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.\nThe younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:\n\"It's alright. I just need some rest.\"\nSeeing that smile, the innocent younger sister's eyes filled with expectation. She even began looking forward to playing together like they used to.\nBut one day, she saw her sister gripping her chest while telling a story.\nThen, when her frail form collapsed onto the bed, the younger sister reached out to catch her, only to find that her body was so very light.\n...It was almost as if her sister were a feather, a feather that might drift away to some place far, far away.\nLater on, the younger sister found a crumpled note.\nIt was a doctor's prescription, with a list of herbs that were desperately scarce — the collectors who had such herbs were few and far between.\nTo purchase those herbs would cost more than tens of millions of Mora, an impossible price for a family that was already struggling to make the ends meet.\nThe elder sister always shook her head with a smile to dismiss her family's insistence on following the prescription. Perhaps she herself could only find the courage to glance at that note in the deep hours of the night — and dare to dream that she might \"live.\"\nUpon finding out about the note, the younger sister put it into her pocket silently and resolved to save her sister.\n\"I must make a lot of Mora.\"\n\"With enough Mora, my family will never have to smile at me while swallowing their pain, and I will never have to lose anything due to lacking Mora...\"\nPerhaps it was at that moment that the gods looked upon her with mercy.\nBut to an \"ambitious\" person like her, getting a Vision was just the start.\nIn the countless days and nights that have followed, she has constantly kept herself calm and clear-headed, telling herself:\n\"Conviction alone is not enough. I will work hard for what I desire until the end of my days.\"\n\"There's nothing that Lord Sangemah Bay cannot achieve.\""

No art form is eternal. The day when all of its value has been exploited is the day it loses its reason for existence.\"\n\"Like how overripe fruits fall to the earth and provide nourishment for new plants.\"\nMessage\n\"And that is exactly why I've always despised materialists like you. Art is a precious fruit of leisure. You can't compare it to production and exploitation for commercial purposes!\"\nAnother Person's Message\n\"Leisurely people are like people walking on a spherical ground - they don't exist. Why don't you use your brain and think for a moment? Can the production of anything exist without commercial exchange?\"\nActing Manager's Reply\n\"What a sharp clash of theories... Anyway, it's time for Mr. Kaveh to settle his bill for the month. Should it be put on your tab as usual, Mr. Alhaitham?\"\nAnother Person's Message\n\"No. That spoiled guy needs to experience the brutality of the business world.\"\nMessage Seemingly From a Noble\n\"Miss Acting Manager, please put it on Lord Sangemah Bay's tab.
