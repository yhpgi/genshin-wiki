Thus eternity is cyclical.\nThe search for truth is a product of prosperity, and not the seed that plants it.\nThey say that,\nOnce upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from Celestia directly.\nThe envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then. In those days, life was weak, and the earth was blanketed in unending ice."
