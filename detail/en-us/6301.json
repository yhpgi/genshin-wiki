Behind him was a large,\nbright moon.\nHe shouted out the names of everyone\nin the village. The Village Chief\nwas first to be named, and so frightened\nwas he that he wished\nto climb up the haystack\nAnd stop up Francois's mouth.\n\"Are you crazy!? You're yelling so loudly\nthe dragon might show up!\"\n\"You good-for-nothing!\nHave you not seen how the windmill\neveryone built has been destroyed\nby the dragon!?\nAnd here you are,\nworrying if it'll return!?\" Francois\nreally would have loved to kick him off\nthe haystack, but held back\ngiven that the Chief, too,\nwas worried for the villagers'\nsafety.\nFrancois saw that nigh all\nthe villagers had arrived,\nand so he cleared his throat.\n\"Dear neighbors and kin,\nthink you still that we must endure this?\"\n\"No, of course not, but we cannot\ndo anything about the dragon,\"\nsaid the grocer.\n\"Who says so? Did I not leap onto its neck\nfrom the windmill blades,\nstepping on it twice, and did\nit not fall down and flee?\"\nPerhaps everyone worked so hard\nto build the mill\nthat was destroyed, everyone's emotions\nbeca█e █nflamed.\nLift█n██their fists, they decided\nto tak███n the dragon!\nBut Francois lifted his own hands,\nand calmed the crowd:\n\"Let us go home for today, everyone.\nEveryone's present\nlack of self-preservation is not bravery,\nbut rather wrath.\nIf we yet desire to face danger after\ncalming ourselves, only then may we\ntruthfully call our sentiment 'valor.'\"\nSo everyone went home.\nThe next day, there were still many\nyoungsters who wished to follow\nFrancois to take on the wicked dragon.\n.....\nWho would have known that the valiant\npossess the protection of the goddess's\nRadiant Charter? Encountering true \"valor,\"\nThe dragon could neither spout fire\nnor slash with claws, and was forced to\nallow the other party\nto call pauses and switch personnel.\nAnd so, after several days\nand nights of fierce fighting, the\nwicked dragon could no longer bear it,\nand chose to surrender.\n...\nA.A."
