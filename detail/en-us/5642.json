Ugh, things are gonna get ugly if he succeeds!\nWe don't know what's become of Monsieur Os, either...\nBut we've got no choice but to keep going...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Continue onward</color>\n<color=#ece5d8>Sacellum Requietis</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Boethius:</color>\nPersistent garbage...\nDid you repair the broken aqueducts to celebrate my birth as the god of ancient days?\nI must warn you, my new world requires no such things, nor will I require ships...\nFor all shall find eternal happiness within my \"Symphony.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nWe're about to add some end bar lines to your score.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's right!

You...!\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nI have you at last, Boethius. All your will is here, and Phobos also — this time, there is no escape.\n<color=#ffffff>Boethius:</color>\nWhy!? I am a Harmost! The conductor of the symphony! How? How did you...\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nHave you forgotten? Before the Sebastos cut me away, I too was a Harmost! And now that I have returned to the symphony, you are the sole conductor no longer!\n<color=#ffffff>Boethius:</color>\nHah! So you agreed to join me just to lower my guard, only to betray me once more! Me, and Remuria both!\nThink of our kin, tragically imprisoned beneath the waters, of the torment they've suffered for millennia...\nWill you truly destroy our cause, obliterate our final hope, for the sake of those who scurry and crawl on dry land!?\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nYou are the traitor here, and the one who imprisoned our people. That is why our nation fell to its ruinous fate!\nThe justice that our Sebastos... the Imperator gave unto us, that golden ideal, was for us to follow the melody of our hearts and obtain the freedom to grasp our fate.\nWe did not wish to be judged by Fortuna, much less to become your slaves.\nAfter Phobos was shattered, the people should have gained their freedom. If not for your deception, their nightmare would have ended long ago.\n<color=#ffffff>Boethius:</color>\nRemuria has not fallen! With Phobos as its guiding star, it shall rise again!\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\n\"Though rock and metal may crash and clamor, humans cannot live without water and soil.\"\nNo power, however great, that tramples upon the value of life has any meaning.\nAre you not human yourself, Boethius? We Remurians were all ordinary Fontainians once.\nThough we forsook our flesh, wracked with pain and weakness, and gained immortal forms, we still have mortal souls, mortal emotions, and mortal frailties.\nBut we forgot that. We forgot where we came from. Believed ourselves superior to other humans. That is why Remuria fell.\nDo you remember my words, Traveler? Now is the time!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Defeat Boethius</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nLay your delusions aside, Boethius. There is still time to turn back...\n<color=#ffffff>Boethius:</color>\nWhy, Cassiodor!? Why!? You betray me once more, betray all of Remuria...\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nWhat this world needs is progress, not a cycle bereft of meaning...\n<color=#ffffff>Boethius:</color>\nNo... No! Never!\nDeplete Boethius's health\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOoh, Paimon's kinda dizzy now...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nCassiodor...\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nTraveler, and Paimon. I didn't think we would be able to meet again like this.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYou... You're Monsieur Os!\nWow, Boethius is here too... He's not gonna try anything funny, is he?\nNo, wait! Are Paimon's eyes deceiving her? What's that thing floating over there!?\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nYou see it too, then? The being that hovers behind the illusion of \"Boethius.\"\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color>\nAhaha! You found me, I see!\nNo illusion it is that you see. You gaze upon \"Boethius\" in truth, for I am, in truth, \"Boethius\"!\nOf course, I am not only \"him,\" but \"you,\" also...\nI am every melody, every movement, every thought... I am the sum of all souls!\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nI am... \"Phobos.\"\nThis does not include you children from beyond, however. You are not part of \"us.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\n\"Phobos\"... So, the great Symphony that governs all has a persona?\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\n\"Phobos,\" or should I say that-which-was-once-Sybilla, was originally a survivor of the last deluge that swallowed the earth.\nSybilla's wish was to grant happiness to all in the world who are called humans. But she had no persona, and her strength was insufficient.\nThus, she entrusted her wisdom to Remus, and with the addition of the power that Remus possessed, the\nwas created. That is to say, me.\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nNo, how can this...\nSo, the music we have played all this time, and the fate we accepted... That all came from you...\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nYes, it is \"me,\" but it is also \"all of you\"! \"I\" am also \"you all.\" I am the aggregate of all your wishes.\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nEliminating our enemies, destroying other lives, destroying cities and villages... Are these also our wishes!?\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nPrecisely! That's what \"you\" wished for, and so \"I\" responded. Plunder, hatred, slaughter... These too are part of \"your\" wishes.\nIs that not what it means to give \"everyone\" happiness?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nPreposterous...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nDon't be absurd! That's just twisted and wrong!\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\n...No, those aren't our true wishes. The arrogance and hatred that festered within us warped you, turning you into a terrifying monstrosity...\nSuch things will make no one happy. Not us, not any other living being!\nNo wonder you led us to destruction. The Imperator himself must have sensed it, and that's why he...\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nRemus... Yes, he did attempt to destroy me. But why? Without me, \"all of you\" would once again have been plunged into confusion and agony...\nAaahh... So, for all your sakes, I had no choice but to...\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nWait, what!? Do you mean to say that Boethius, even then, had already...\nYes, that must be it... We could never have gone against the Sebastos's commands, unless the very \"Symphony\" had rebelled against him... What of Boethius? What have you done with him?\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nWell, he's become \"us,\" of course. Or, put in a way you might understand, I ate him!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAte him... Oh no...\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nHmm? But that was also his wish, one only I could fulfill... I'm sure that it made him most happy indeed!\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nSo that's why Boethius became your puppet... And why he did all he could to engineer your return.\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nIt's all for the happiness of \"you\"... for \"everyone.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nHahahaha... No. No! It is time we put an end to all this...\nI have trapped you in this body. There's no way out — I shall destroy you utterly.\n<color=#ffffff>\"Phobos\":</color>\nIs \"your\" wish to disappear together with \"me\"? Would that make you happy? But... I can't fulfill that wish.\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nI am Remurian no longer, and I cannot become Fontainian. I already chose my fate when I agreed to help the Sebastos attain his wish.\nSo yes, this is my wish, the reason for which I have wandered this world...\n...I will end this millennia-old nightmare!\nNow, Traveler! Phobos and I... destroy us both!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nBut...\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nI am filled with joy, Traveler! For I have just learned of the Sebastos's plans and hopes...\nThe Imperator aimed to free everyone from the Symphony, from hatred and strife, through his sacrifice.\nEven to the last, he desired to save his people... Now, I shall fulfill the wish he could not see through. This is our final chance, and only you can help us seize it.\nThat is why the Imperator... why fate brought you here, my friend!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Defeat Boethius or Cassiodor</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nThis is our final chance, Traveler...\nDo not hesitate. Take up your sword, and bring all this to an end...\nThis is the fate I chose long ago...\nAfter the battle\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nMonsieur Os... Is that you...?\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nIt's finally... over...\nIt seems that I shall soon fade...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Monsieur Os...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Cassiodor...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nIt's alright. I have finished walking the road I was meant to, and fulfilled that which I was meant to fulfill. This world shall no longer have Cassiodor, nor shall it have the Golden Hunter.\nI am certain that the people of this present world shall continue to live normal, happy lives...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nBut... But...\n<color=#ffffff>Cassiodor:</color>\nTraveler, Paimon, you have my thanks for accompanying me up to this point...\nMy journey has reached its final destination...\nBut yours has yet to end.\nPlease, play the Requiem, for me, and for my Imperator's wishes. Let our souls return to the present world, and return to the great sea...\n\"If water loses its clarity, how shall it become water again? If a tree leaves the soil, where shall it go to put down roots?\"\n\"Though rock and metal may crash and clamor, humans cannot live without water and soil.\"\nPerhaps we shall meet again someday, in a fertile land full of flowing water...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Head to the upper level of \"Domus Aurea\"</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> <color=#ffffff73>Complete the final Requiem and send all the souls back to the present world. This, too, is Cassiodor's last wish...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Head to the \"podium\"</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nGuess we can't call him Monsieur Os anymore...\nBut \"Osse\"... That should be fine, right?\nMeet Scylla at the podium\n<color=#ffffff>Osse:</color>\nMeow!? Meow!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, big guy! You scared Osse!\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nYou mean Cassiodor? No... that familiar feeling has disappeared. Where has Cassiodor gone off to? Has he returned to one of those stone bodies again...?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Cassiodor...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Is no longer with us.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nCassiodor... Monsieur Os, he... he's disappeared... along with Boethius and Phobos...\n<color=#ffffff>After explaining the whole tale to Scylla, you spend some time comforting Osse...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat's right. Now, all that's left is \"Osse\"...\n<color=#ffffff>Osse:</color>\nMeow, meow?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHaha, good going, Osse! Guess you were just surprised by this big guy's appearance, huh? Who's a brave kitty, hmm? That's right, you are!\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nSo, you vanquished that evil apparition, and Cassiodor... was able to fulfill his own wishes.\nI am certain that his soul has returned to the deep waters, and is now reunited with his kin!\nSo long as we complete Remus's final symphony, we shall be able to send their souls back to the present, back to the High Sea...\nLife flows like water. They will join the current, and one day, they will surely be reborn as mortals.\nWell then. Let us begin.\nPerform this final movement, this final Requiem.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Start playing the harp</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Return to Petrichor</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Following the current comprised of congregated souls uncounted, you depart from the underwater realm.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>You follow the spirit-guiding golden bee up, and up, and up...</color>\n<color=#ece5d8>Petrichor</color>\n<color=#ffffff>After everything is over, you return to where it all began, the town of Petrichor...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to Scylla</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nIs the Symphony that Remus left to us... finally coming to an end?\nWe've completed the Requiem, and the souls imprisoned in the ocean depths all seem to have left.\nThe townspeople should be back to normal as well, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nThank you both for completing this final musical movement, these wishes that have endured for thousands of years.\nWhether it was mine, Remus's, or that of anyone who wishes to protect peace in this world.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThat reminds Paimon of Monsieur Os...\n<color=#ffffff>Osse:</color>\nMeow meow!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYou like that name, too? Hehe, we're not talking about you right now, though.\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nHis soul has returned to the High Sea. There, at last, he can be at peace. I imagine that was akin to release for him.\nAs for my kindred and descendants, it seems that a new, true dragon has been born to us.\nThough, as one who was a prince amongst Hydro Vishaps, I should go forth and seek an audience with him... Though it is hard to say if I still count as Dragonborn now.\nToo much time has passed, so much that little in this world has anything to do with me.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo what do you plan to do next?\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nWell, now! It was not easy to regain my freedom, so I believe I shall have a good romp underwater!\nAfter all, there are none who shall disturb me any longer, save you, perhaps!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, what do you mean, \"disturb\"?\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nHaha, I jest. Still, are you not due to return to your own place? Let us part ways here, then.\nOr so I would say, but further visits on your part would be appreciated. I might get lonely now that everyone is gone, after all!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe! Aw, you just miss us already, don'cha, you big lunk?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>See you around, big guy.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We will meet again.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla:</color>\nHeh. Looking at you, even I begin to look forward to the future of terrestrial beings!\nWell then. Until we meet again.\n<color=#ffffff>Scylla leaves amidst the turbulent waves...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWell, where should we go next?\nOh, right! We should get back to Mr. Este to tell him that everything's fine now. We did promise to, after all!\nAnd there's Osse, too... Hmm, what should we call him now? This could get complicated...\nAnyway, let's get back to town first."
