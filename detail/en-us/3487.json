Thus the people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness. As for the Cleansing Bell, the Geo Archon granted it to Streetward Rambler for safekeeping to honor Guizhong's memory. Each time Streetward Rambler rang the Cleansing Bell, it was to play the tune that Guizhong composed on it. Guizhong's manuscripts still lie unfinished in the Realm of Clouds.
