Steel monsters as vast as galaxies lurk beneath the ground and devour people in the thousands.\nBut there also exist powerful beings who can make rooms comfortable in any season and turn night into day with a snap of their fingers. This is a story as groundless as it is meaningless.\nIt only shares one thing in common with the real world: most of the precious metals are owned by a handful of individuals, who keep them locked up in the vault."
