Even those looking to be made whole can feel the moonlight's pristine blessing flowing beneath their skin. Even the smallest blessings, accumulated, can guide the pious scions immersed in them closer to the coming Elysium.<br>All sins and wicked thoughts are cleansed by the pristine moonlight, all tears and suffering are necessary sacrifices â€” at least that is what the people who worship the moon once firmly believed.",
