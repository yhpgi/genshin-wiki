Really easy to get along with. Last time he visited us in Gandharva Ville, he insisted on showing off his tent-pitching skills and had a fishing competition with Cyno. Collei got really upset, because she thought there was nothing for her to do anymore...</p><p>People say Sethos is good at keeping himself amused — he certainly seems pretty cheerful. But he takes his work very seriously. Hmm, although I don't know how accurate \"work\" is — I think he sees his role at the Temple of Silence as more of a kind of duty. Anyway, if you ever find yourself needing assistance in the desert, I'm sure he'd be a good person to go to.</p>",

It should be passionately embraced by those who are curious about it as opposed to becoming a tool for survival, doled out in limited amounts.\nUnfortunately, as a young researcher, Tighnari did not have anywhere near the clout to stand against the Akademiya, and even now he can only do what he can in a limited capacity.\nAt the same time, reality does not quite match up to one's ideals—\nAs such, some unlucky soul getting lectured by Tighnari is no uncommon sight in Avidya Forest."

Could you look over the journal entry I wrote for today?\"\n\"General Watchleader! I've found some baggage down in the Chinvat Ravine. I've placed at the lost and found section.\"\n\"Oh no, where has Sag gone... Um, General Watchleader, have you seen it around?\"\nHe at first took this for slips of the tongue, but many recurrences later, this sign would see his brows burrow.\n\"Do we actually have that rank? Or are we going for something similar to 'General Mahamatra'?\"\nWhatever the case, Tighnari would eventually prevail upon everyone to go back to calling him \"Forest Watcher,\" \"Master,\" or \"Mr. Tighnari.\"\n\"I'm afraid 'General Watchleader' is too great a title for me to bear,\" or so he said.\n\"Heh, that actually reminded me of a joke someone once told about the title of 'General Mahamatra'...\"\nHe did not make mention of this other reason for his refusal of that title."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 4</color>\nThere was a time when a certain vibrantly-colored flower was all the rage amongst the people of Sumeru. Many people would buy it to adorn their houses, and thus it gradually became a trend.\nUnfortunately, this flower was not long for the world if removed from the rainforest, and would only last two days at best if so plucked.\nFlowers that were no longer fresh would soon be discarded, left by the wayside to rot — a shame by any standard of imagination.\nThis could not go on. Never mind the garbage or pollution-related issues, this trend ran the risk of damaging the forest ecosystem if it persisted long enough.\nHowever, just as the Forest Rangers were mulling over this problem, Tighnari would send out an offer of cooperation with the flower sellers in the city:\nThe Forest Rangers would help them gather fresh flowers for free, but that they should provide an additional service, informing those who came to purchase the flowers that if they sent them back by the second day, they would obtain a receipt that could then be exchanged within the next 3 days for a dried flower decoration.\nThese decorations were of course provided by Tighnari and the Forest Rangers. The option to pay for them and how much to pay would be left up to the buyer of the flowers, just as things might go at a charity bazaar.\nPart of this Mora would go to the store owner as service charge for collecting the leftover flowers, and the rest would be used for funding the Forest Rangers' efforts to maintain the rainforest.\nThis cooperation went quite smoothly indeed. The flower shop owners saved themselves the trouble of searching deep within the rainforest for their floral quarry and got some extra income; the Forest Rangers got to control the process and amount of flowers gathered, and also got some extra funds; those who bought flowers would not only receive a temporary flower as a companion, but also a more permanent memento.\nThis all went quite swimmingly, but some rangers did not understand, asking: \"Why didn't we just ban the gathering of such flowers in the first place? Wouldn't that have been simpler?\"\nTighnari shook his head when he heard this answer, causing his ears to shake.\n\"We shouldn't make such simple calculations. If we were to force our requests through, we would be just like a stolid lecturer who fails to have others understand, but who stirs up feelings of rebellion instead.\"\n\"If that were to happen, our reputation would be the least of our woes — we would have our hands full trying to deal with those who were coming to pick flowers illegally!\"\n\"In any case, trends will change. Don't worry. I'm sure the people's attention will shift to something else soon.\"\nPragmatic as these words were, they quickly found traction with the Forest Rangers. Collei's nods were particularly rapid.\n\"The dried flower decorations that Master taught us to make have been pretty popular with the children, too!\""

When his seminar courses would end, he would often go along with requests for group photos.\nNot that he really understood them, but he agreed anyway.\nThat was how \"Tighnari knows everything, and he's so nice to talk to!\" became a widespread saying, causing many to fight for his time. Even students from other Darshans would want to collaborate with him.\nThis went on till one day, when his popularity also attracted the attention of the General Mahamatra Cyno—\nForming factions and gathering forces... these were nothing if not the harbingers of academic corruption!\nYet with some time spent observing Tigharni, Cyno found that the former had only received people out of the goodness of his heart.\nTighnari himself only really had eyes for his work, and was dispassionate concerning the offers of others.\nCertainly he would agree to collaborate, but only in the interests of furthering his research in the best way possible.\nUltimately, Cyno's judgment was as such: \"This is an upright and reliable talent who has no questionable dealings. Threat resolved.\"\nIt was perhaps due to this pure impression that the General Mahamatra, known for distancing himself from scholarship and scholars alike, would let down his guard and become friends with Tighnari in the days to come.\nThese factors would all culminate in yet another meeting with another comrade.\n\"This young lady's name is Collei?\"\n\"It's okay if you can't read or write. We all start having no knowledge — in this you are no different from anyone else.\"\n\"Shall we start with writing your name, then?\""

Thus did Tighnari immediately ask his father to bring him — the 'large desert dog' back to the desert to have a look on his next surveying trip.\nUnfortunately, they met with an accident. Not a few meters into the desert, Tighnari fell into a faint from the heat and had to be rushed back to the rainforest.\n\"Oh no,\" Tighnari thought sadly as he convalesced in his treehouse, \"the 'large desert dogs' have devolved in my generation.\"\nMany years later, the ignorant child had become a reliable researcher, and this event had become a joke consigned to the past.\nNowadays, Tighnari not only knows why those little Aranara gave them this name, but also why he faints easily from the desert heat.\nThe former is simple. Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both canines, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.\nAs for the latter, though Tighnari is loath to admit it, it probably had something to do with what his father said then as he tousled his hair.\n\"This lad's fur is an intensely dark shade of green. He's going to have trouble in the desert heat for sure!\""

Light and cogent in design, it could immediately be recognized as a tool suited for children.\n\"Your ears can already help you hear sounds from reeeaaally far away, so let this magnifying glass help you see smaller things!\"\nThus did Tighnari use this device to see the veins on the back of leaves, the powder that hung off butterfly wings, and the trails of the rainforest snakes...\nIt was through this gradual observation, collection, and consideration that he was eventually admitted into Amurta early, beginning his official learning journey under the Sage there.\nTighnari placed the magnifying glass, scarred and weathered by many years of use, on top of his brand new invitation letter, placed his hands on his cheeks, and thought for a good long while.\nFinally, he had this constant companion of his converted into an ornament that he might wear on his person.\nHe knew that once he entered the Akademiya, he would study more complex books and access more marvelous instruments, and that there was little place for this old beginner's magnifying glass.\nHowever, it would always be his companion in his search for knowledge, and would follow him to see lands wider and vaster still."

This sight is most commonplace at such conferences.\nBut strictly speaking, what researcher, adrift amidst the vast sea of information, will not make mistakes in their investigations?\nAt one such conference that Tighnari attended, one speaker spoke of things that Tighnari knew to be untrue.\nThen, he was just a bystander and a listener. Glancing around his surroundings almost subconsciously, he noticed that neither his classmates nor his teachers had said anything.\nWhat should he do? Perhaps everyone indeed knew what the problem was, but did not want to make the speaker lose face.\nOr perhaps he was the only one who had noticed the problem, and his silence now would cause misinformation to spread...\nBut Tighnari did not hesitate long before steeling himself.\nThough both his status and the scene were obstacles in his path, the rigor of knowledge eventually won out.\nAfter all, knowledge was like a star blazing through the night sky. Nothing would divert its path.\nSo thinking, Tighnari raised his hand—\n\"My apologies. If I may interject—\" The researcher onstage was at first a bit shocked to hear his gentle voice, but reacted swiftly and invited him to elaborate.\nAs it turned out, Tighnari had done the right thing.\nThe speaker, after having processed enough of the information, accepted his corrections earnestly.\nAnd once their exchange had ended, other students and teachers in attendance would also speak in their turn, leading to new research angles opening up for the topics discussed at the conference. Tighnari himself would also receive namecards from some well-known researchers.\nOnce the whole incident was over, Tighnari would heave a sigh of relief.\nThat was a fortunate... No, indeed, a joyous thing that those who studied alongside him also accorded knowledge the gravitas it deserved.\nBut he had not yet counted on something still more fortunate and joyous to occur.\nWhen the meeting ended and Tighnari stood to leave, he heard a crisp, clear \"clink!\"\n—Lo and behold, a Vision rolled off his garments onto the chair below."
