The pup became cold and mean forever after, and whenever other animals showed kindness to him, he would repay them with the harshest of words or the most woeful of deeds. In the end, every animal loathed him.\nFrom then on, every wolf in the forest spoke of the pup in this way:\n\"Woof, what a selfish wolf he is! Such an obnoxious kid.\"\n\"Woof, woof, what a heartless wolf he is! Let us stay away from him.\"\nOne by one, the pup lost all his friends. The forest welcomed the lonely pup no more, so he had no choice but to head north.\nThe blizzards that blew in the northern tundra kept most creatures away. But with his heart already frozen solid, the pup was no longer afraid of the cold.\nHe decided to settle down there, and became the lone wolf that roamed the tundra.\n(A young girl has written in the corner of the page: \"Dada, but where did Woobakwa go?\")"
