During the battle, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan trapped the Traveler and Paimon and showed the Tepetlisaurus the true Heart of the Sacred Mountain, where the remains of the slain Pyro Dragon remained. The Sage of the Stolen Flame gave the Saurian the guidance of the true Sacred Flame so that he could control the power of the Flamelord. From a small Saurian, the Tepetlisaurus grew into an adult who was able to speak and whose body was able to withstand all the power."

The Sage of the Stolen Flame needed both Chosen of Dragons, the human and their Saurian companion, to enter the Sacred Mountain. But the human's mission was complete, and now the Tepetlisaurus had to activate Huitzilopochtli so that the great enemy hidden in the shadows could never invade again. He promised that when Natlan turned to phlogiston, the concept of life would be rewritten, and the power of the Primal Fire would return naturally. Only the dragons who had turned into phlogiston life forms would have all the power, and the Tepetlisaurus would become the new ruler, existing outside of normal boundaries and concepts. He would return all light, all warmth, all wisdom, bringing great order and glory to this world.\nWhen Huitzilopochtli was activated, a world of pure white stretched before the Tepetlisaurus. Ten million years passed in what seemed but a moment, but time had no meaning. The only consciousness left in this world was \"it,\" which had once been the Tepetlisaurus. Many great and mighty things happened in the world that once was. Countless wars of inconceivable scale, battles that tore dimensions asunder, uncounted lives swallowed and transformed until the blazing light devoured the most primordial rule. The shadow no longer threatened the world, but was it a world with any meaning? \"It\" knew that the primal flame was not inexhaustible, although it would burn for billions of years in this dark cosmic sea. Sometimes, \"it\" recalled, as if in a dream, how long ago it had traveled alongside two companions when the land was still tangible. Holding on to these memories, \"it\" thought it might yet endure the torment until death comes upon eternity's far shore. If \"it\" could return to the Heart of the Sacred City, would it make a different choice?\nSeeing the fate that Huitzilopochtli had in store for the world and the Traveler and Paimon, the Tepetlisaurus refused to activate the Sweeping Skyfire and made the same choice as Waxaklahun Ubah Kan at the beginning of his journey. Knowing that he would lose his powers and the wisdom of the dragons, the Tepetlisaurus returned to the Traveler and Paimon and freed them from the trap. After defeating the mechanical dragon, the Tepetlisaurus became small again and lost consciousness."
