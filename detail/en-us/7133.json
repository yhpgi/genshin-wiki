It is said that in the past, tribal warriors would watch these crimson Saurians amuse themselves by tossing flaming stones from great heights; and that it was this that first inspired them to set off projectiles to cause explosive chain reactions. This concept, gradually refined over time, is said to have been the origin of many of the Flower-Feather Clan's firearms.",
