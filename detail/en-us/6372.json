As such, I do not think you will read a word I write here — I write to myself alone.\nNeither of us ever had any magic or combat training. We are simply ordinary. As such, we might be able to come to an understanding, though I believe otherwise. Alice was too ██ing good to you. Back in the day, she dragged me through waterways, blowing furnaces up, catching a cat within a Domain... The process was complicated and far from straightforward, but in any case, it was meant to protect the people around us.\nYou might have wondered, is this the price of getting along with this gaggle of mad women? I doubt you would agree with that assessment, nor would I. Those were, after all, the most precious days of our time together, were they not?"
