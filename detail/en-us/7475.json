        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Story 2</color>\nIn the early days when Tatarasuna was still a prosperous place, the Wanderer walked amongst its people, going by the name \"Kabukimono.\"\nAnd the thing that ended his peaceful life was not all that important in the grand scale of Inazuma's history.\nChange came to the place in the form of the Akame Clan and a mechanic from Fontaine named Escher. The two cooperated very closely to further improve forging quality, and in the process, Akame introduced Escher to Niwa, who was also from the three Isshin traditions.\nEscher's arrival caused quite the stir for a time, for it was through his revolutionary new techniques that they were able to process Crystal Marrow in such a way that their forging efficacy and production were both increased.\nBut as time passed, anomalies emerged within the great central furnace in Tatarasuna. Black gas gathered within the furnace, and it would gradually affect the bodies of the craftspeople there. Forging and smelting were the foundations of life in Tatarasuna, but now they had become death itself.\nAnd as the toll mounted, the great furnace further went out of control. None could get close to its core, and even stopping it became nigh impossible.\nAs the highest authority at Tatarasuna, Niwa was forced to enact an information blackout while sending people to Inazuma City to beg aid from Tenshukaku.\nFor some reason, however, those who took to the sea in ships never returned. Horror began seeping into the hearts of Tatarasuna's people.\nThe Kabukimono knew that Niwa needed the Raiden Shogun's aid, but did not know that this was the very year when she had successfully built the perfect puppet using parts of herself as material, thus handing over management of the nation to the Guardian of Eternity. He thus boarded a small boat and braved storm and rain to arrive at Tenshukaku, seeking an audience with the Shogun.\nBut she now dwelled in the Plane of Euthymia, and he was repeatedly refused. In desperation, he displayed the golden feather on his person and asked to see Yae Miko instead.\nAt this time, Miko was busy assisting the Guardian, and though she rushed down as soon as she heard this news, she could only meet the distressed Kabukimono briefly. Yet he had no ears for her promises to send people to their aid immediately, and returned in despair, convinced that the Shogunate had forsaken Tatarasuna.\nStill, the dispatch was sent, the people were mobilized, and they crossed by sea. Yet they arrived to no great disaster. Indeed, most people knew nothing of what had happened. It was the mechanic, Escher, who explained that Niwa had fled with his family for fear of punishment for his malfeasance, and that the Kabukimono had gone into the core zone in his place, shutting the furnace down.\nReceiving word that the Kabukimono had been friends with the fleeing Niwa, Yae guessed at the heaviness in his heart and did not wish to further disturb him, merely sending someone to return the feather to him.\nLater still, he would disappear without a trace from Tatarasuna. But as people reminisced, they could never forget the celebratory dance he had performed together with them on the day that Mikoshi Nagamasa successfully forged his great blade.\nHis steps fluttered lightly like a feather in the wind then, and they could not have known that he, like a feather, would depart from them and journey to places unknown.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 4</color>\nThe sixth of Snezhnaya's Fatui Harbingers is known as The Balladeer.\nAnd yet this name was not his to own from the start. Indeed, they were yet separated by over a hundred years.\nAfter leaving Inazuma, he forsook the name Kabukimono, reverting to his nameless state, and did not even consider taking another until The Jester found him.\nIn the end, such titles as \"puppet\" or \"Kabukimono\" were all given to him by mortals. And since he would no longer have them as companions, there was no point in using the names they gave him.\nBut The Jester proved most persuasive, and the puppet was intrigued by the frenzied banquet he spoke of, and so accompanied the man to Snezhnaya to serve in the Fatui.\nA stranger named The Doctor would welcome him warmly in this frigid northern land, inviting the Wanderer to be the key reference material in his experiments — his grand research project.\nPuppet-making techniques had their roots in Khaenri'ah, and his nature as a creation of the Electro Archon made him all the more special. The Doctor was fascinated by this field of study, and, using the Wanderer as a foundational blueprint, would perform research and experiments for several decades before finally attaining the techniques that would go on to form the basis for his Segments.\nIn return, The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers.\nBut even so, he did not choose another name. His colleagues called him the \"puppet,\" and so he saw himself also — a puppet, unafraid of death and inexhaustible.\nOn the Tsaritsa's orders, he would lead a company to explore the Abyss, and there he spent much time. More than once he was wounded, then repaired by The Doctor, and thus he grew stronger, surviving to be wounded again by ever mightier foes.\nMuch later, he would bring the results of his exploration back to Snezhnaya, gaining the sixth seat in the process. His orders were also changed. Instead of exploring the Abyss, he was now to constantly be on standby, assisting the clandestine activities of the Fatui across the world.\nAnd it was only then that he felt that that new name, \"The Balladeer,\" fit him.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 5</color>\nThe many things that happened after that might even be called soul-stirring, but for the fact that few now remember them.\nOnly those who witnessed those events would keep them as legends in their hearts, and so they continue to quietly exist, as ancient songs lost to the world.\nWithin Irminsul, The Balladeer came into contact with the \"truth\" that Lesser Lord Kusanali had placed within the flow of information. This secret had been hidden within one of The Doctor's many hearts, and just as she claimed, this truth in first person contained all his remaining honesty.\nAnd thus did The Balladeer come to know of past truths: Niwa, who had taught him how to live like an ordinary human and treated him like one, had not fled Tatarasuna to escape punishment as Escher had claimed. In fact, the true culprit had been Escher — no, The Doctor — all along. And as for the heart that had been placed within The Balladeer, it had been cut, still warm, from Niwa's breast.\nThis death had been nicely packaged within an incident at the forge, and such was Escher's silvered tongue that he all too quickly convinced everyone that this was due to the failings of the local overseer.\nAs the next person in charge, Mikoshi Nagamasa would have faced capital punishment if not for the intervention of his loyal samurai retainer, Katsuragi, who willingly took the burden of wrongdoing upon himself.\nThe tragedy that followed need not be elaborated upon. Nagamasa, unwilling as he was, had to wash the stain from the Mikoshi name, and could not allow himself to die here.\nAnd so he brought forth his beloved blade, the Daitatara Nagamasa, and struck Katsuragi down in a single blow, the blade cutting so deep that it nearly split the slain man in twain...\n...And had they not all believed in their god?\nWhy then, did they have to face such a calamity?\nIf the enigmatic puppet they called the Kabukimono had never existed, would Escher have done the same thing there?\nEven if the chance were infinitesimal, could the tragedy of Tatarasuna have been salvaged?\nAnyone anywhere else in this world would be able to do nothing about this, but not The Balladeer. He knew that he alone could attempt this one thing, here and now.\nHe believed himself bold, for he feared not death. Death was but a tiny threat to a puppet, and only humans with hearts knew horror.\nHe also knew himself to be craven, and for that he had remorse. If he had been then more like he was at present... if he had learned to be less trusting... Would those he had viewed as friends have met such a ruinous end?\nTraitor, hero, god, discarded detritus — all these identities would cease to matter to one who leaped into the flux.\nThe information flow was a place of incomparable silence, and yet his blood roiled in his ears, and his mind roared.\nEmbrace oblivion!\nThe puppet was a discarded milksop, the Kabukimono unaccomplished and sheltered, and Scaramouche was a schemer — one who eventually went against divine decree, seeking to go against the tides of the world.\nBut what of it?\nOnce upon a time, these inhuman hands had shut a great blazing furnace without caring if his ten fingers were burned to a crisp.\nNow, these hands grasped at the tiniest possibility, twisting the truth to fulfill his wish.\nYes, embrace it, embrace it with this form that shall be obliterated!\nTo ruin with this life, as worthless as flowers and feathers and the dawn dew!\nFarewell, world! The future shall be what it will. Farewell nonetheless!"

Somehow it's starting to seem like you intend to take it by force now.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Hahaha... I'm merely stating a fact.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : After all, I'm also a scholar.

And if so... how do the Fatui plan to deal with the consequences?\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : Do you dare... to gamble such a possibility with me?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Hmph, \"gamble\"? How surprising.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : I thought you would show evidence or use rigorous reasoning to prove your point... The word \"gamble\" is the last thing I expected to hear from the God of Wisdom.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : But this is a clever move. You must have seen through me when I first captured your consciousness.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : As a scholar, I respect all possibilities. This has always been my principle and is an essential trait as an experimenter.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Indeed, I can't ignore this possibility. So tell me then, what are your conditions?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : This foreign Gnosis will only lead to disaster if it stays in Sumeru...\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : But this Electro Gnosis is the prize I obtained after defeating one of your fellow Harbingers.\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : Now, as the one who initiated this cascade of events, shouldn't you pay the corresponding price?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Price? Interesting. What price would you have me pay?\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : ...How about erasing all your other segments?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Hahaha... So this is how you wish to restrict me, the most threatening opponent of the Nation of Wisdom. What you request of me is like plucking out the eyes I have placed in the dimension of time.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Segments are extraordinarily difficult to make. They require extremely rare resources and enormous amounts of time and effort. Requiring me to destroy them all here and now... Bravo, a suitably wise decision on your part.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Yes, how very interesting... Can I assume that you have long been wary of me?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Among all the versions of me, this segment you see now is the most selfish. If it weren't me, your idea wouldn't have worked.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : What did you see when you were imprisoned? You were observing me, and that's how you know I've long grown tired of their doubts and endless arguments.\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : Like you said, it's difficult to make peace with yourself.\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : Being as smart as you are, have you managed to do that?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : I see. If you think all those versions of me are worth a Gnosis... Then, deal.\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : You sure didn't hesitate much. Is the relationship between all the versions of you really that bad?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : I don't think there's any need to dwell on that. The surplus versions of me can be exchanged for a Gnosis. Do you think anyone can offer themselves at a higher price?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Besides, with my abilities, it's only a matter of time until I find better \"perspectives.\" Perhaps it's best to say... you're just temporarily ahead.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : But what I'd like to know is, how can you be sure that I've really erased them?\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : I can see your remaining honesty...\n<color=#ffd780>About the Dendro Gnosis</color>\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Another chess piece... And where is your Dendro Gnosis?\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : ...Don't be greedy, Harbinger of Snezhnaya.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : No, this is a different transaction. If you intend to turn off the Akasha anyway, then there's no further use for the Gnosis of Sumeru, is there?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Besides, isn't it the archon's duty to deliver what's desired of the seeker?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Oh? Judging from your expression, you don't seem to find the idea very agreeable. Then let's think of it this way... Since you're the God of Wisdom, how about I exchange some knowledge with you?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : People exchanging knowledge with the God of Wisdom is the stuff of legends, yet here you wish to exchange knowledge for the God of Wisdom's property...\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : Arrogant as that is, it has piqued my interest.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Let me ask you... Have you in all your mighty knowledge ever heard the rumor that \"the skies of Teyvat are fake\"?\n<color=#37ffff>Buer</color> : ...Huh?\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : That's the secret hidden by Irminsul concerning the \"truth\" of this world...\n<color=#ffd780>About The Doctor</color>\nActually, it's very smart of the Traveler to be wary of me right now. After all, The Doctor has shown that his technology can apparently even control human minds...\nWhen you left, I was still in the middle of restoring everyone's minds. Thankfully, when The Doctor mentioned \"depositing information into the subconscious,\" he didn't mean engraving information into their minds...\n...Instead, he did something closer to creating hallucinations. That was still within my power to fix.\nLuckily, I managed to finish my restorations and mind-jump away from him just as he was about to capture me.\nI gave away my true identity when I restored everyone's minds, which means we've lost another one of our trump cards.\nAlso... The Doctor is already an expert at modifying Akasha Terminals. Maybe it's only a matter of time until he captures my consciousness inside the Akasha."

As the person currently responsible for her treatment, I cannot possibly sign off on this transfer.\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : Your suggestion is rude and reckless. I'll pass.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : I see, I see. Of course, your opinion makes perfect sense.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Hehe... You're still young, but already quite stubborn. I must say, you are not like what I had expected...\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't just let you off the hook like this, but unfortunately, I'm in a hurry today — what with Her Most Noble Majesty, the Tsaritsa, calling for our return.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : Luckily, there is still some time left for me to take care of everything before I leave.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : It's just as the Akademiya said — you're a responsible and gifted scholar. Sadly, even with all of that, you're still lacking a bit of shrewdness.\n<color=#37ffff>Dottore</color> : And that's also why people like you can never realize that sooner or later, everyone must pay the price for what they've learned.\n<color=#ffd780>About Dottore</color>\n<color=#37ffff>Traveler</color> : Have you ever met The Doctor?\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : Yes, I know him.\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : Actually, he left Pardis Dhyai just a little while ago.\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : The Harbinger you mentioned came to me because he wanted to take the scholar Haypasia away with him.\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : I don't know much about The Doctor. But after talking with him, I realized that just like many other scholars, he possesses an aura of arrogance that I've come to detest.\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : It's not so much that he's looking down on others, but more that he's confident in himself and his abilities to a point of near insanity.\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : I would never refer a patient to someone like him.\n<color=#37ffff>Tighnari</color> : I prepared myself for a protracted battle of wits, and was really surprised to see him just give up on the topic. Still, his reaction really concerned me..."

They are creating a new god... a god that will belong to them, and to the people of Sumeru.\nIt may seem as if Sumeru's academics are thriving, but ever since the death of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, scholarly breakthroughs have been few and far between.\nThe withering of Irminsul has been getting worse recently. The sages have tried everything they could think of, but nothing's worked. I'm always hearing them say things like, \"If only Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was still with us...\"\nAnd then, someone from the Fatui showed up. They called him \"The Doctor\"... He brought a... a \"Gnosis,\" and said he wanted to borrow the Akademiya's research facilities.\nThe Doctor was previously expelled from the Akademiya. At first, the sages looked down at him in disdain... But when he said those words, everyone's expression changed.\nHe asked them: \"Do you wish to create a god?\"\nFirst, the Akademiya spent a long time constructing a \"divine vessel,\" which was based on an exquisite humanoid puppet.\nAfter that, they harvested dreams via the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, maximizing the Akasha's output...\nWith The Doctor's help, and the Akasha now functioning at maximum efficiency, they were able to use it to extract the power from the Gnosis and convert it into a \"divine core.\"\nNext, they decided that their new god needed to possess \"divine wisdom.\" For that to happen... they needed a huge quantity of Divine Canned Knowledge."

You're worrying too much.
