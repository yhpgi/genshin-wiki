Due to certain social adaptations, it has manifested a form aligned with the Electro element.<br>Following the demise of the Ancient Seven Sovereigns, a new generation of Sovereigns is presently being born. But now that the Bathysmal Vishaps have evolved in this manner, they have lost their purity. As such, the Dragon of Water will no longer be born from among their ranks. Prophecy holds that the new Dragon of Water will definitely descend in the form of a human...<br>Though the Dragons of Water that have returned to their complete form still see them as one of their own, they are closer to another race. Perhaps they figured that it is better to be closer to humans, since they chose to work with them, or perhaps they see their potential...</p>",
