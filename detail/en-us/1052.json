Once youth and innocence had faded, how would he treat his elemental descendants? In the twilight of his life, would he blame himself for throwing his life away for a childish promise?\nThe spring fairy was pure and kind, but she did not understand human love. She had never seen the miracle of humanity, and had merely sat idle through millennia of change. And so, she greatly feared parting.\nWhat humans see as the miracle of devotion, elemental fairies can only perceive as fleeting pleasure.\nAnd even the power of fairies cannot reverse the aging of a loved one.\nThe tender fairy could not bear to see that unavoidable day come, and with a kiss she stopped the boy from uttering the words.\nBut the boy, in his innocence, mistook her rejection as her approval of his promise.\nFrom that moment, the fairy vowed that she would someday bear to leave him.\nAnd the boy vowed that he would remain by her spring forever."
