        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Yuegui</color>\nStreetward Rambler has acquaintances all across Liyue, and even early on, she had paid many of them a visit, saying that her newest disciple's training was not quite complete yet, and asking them to take care of the young girl should they encounter her.\nHer original intention was simply to introduce her student and ask that they help teach Yaoyao further, that her eventual learning might increase.\nYaoyao's clever and caring manner, however, proved more lovable than Streetward Rambler had expected, and Cloud Retainer would take the request to heart.\nBefore either master or pupil had realized it, Cloud Retainer had already completed the creation of a wondrous machine rabbit.\n\"Well then, Yaoyao, one purposes to give this to you. Should you encounter any danger, call upon it, and it shall answer.\"\nYaoyao was very taken with this cute rabbit, naming it Yuegui and taking it everywhere with her.\nHaving given this gift, Cloud Retainer would seek out the little girl's master to say, and not without pride, that:\n\"One should inform you first that this device has another function. Should you ever be unable to find Yaoyao, you need only call out, 'Yuegui!', and her location shall be made known to you.\"\n\"Nonetheless, one counsels you not to overuse this feature, for when the child grows older, she will desire her own privacy, and may yet take umbrage to your constant calling upon her. Now, take one's loose relationship with one's pupil Shenhe for example...\"\n\"Oh, not to worry. I understand, Cloud Retainer.\"\n\"And it is good that you do. In any case, Yuegui shall alert us if anyone should try to do her ill without our knowledge — any such churls shall soon need all the luck they can get.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Vision</color>\n\"Why did I receive a Vision?\"\nThis question troubled Yaoyao quite a bit in the days that directly followed her receiving one.\nDid the gods want to reward her for the good deeds she had done? Or was this because she had been a good and respectful pupil?\nSpeaking of which, her senior Xiangling and Aunty Cloud Retainer's student Shenhe both had Visions as well. So, was this because the gods recognized the adepti, and so they would, as a matter of course, also extend this acknowledgment to an adeptus' students?\nBut on further consideration, none of these guesses really made much sense.\nIt was with a sigh that Yaoyao found herself sitting on the slopes behind Liyue Harbor, hugging a dog that had followed her up the incline.\nThis was hardly the first thing she had found incomprehensible since leaving her parents' side, and she had, by and large, decided that her doubts were unavoidable, and could wait till she got older, for surely they might clear up by then!\nBut since she now had a Vision, an item that represented divine acknowledgment, she could not betray such hopes.\nAs a disciple of her master, she would follow her example and protect the people. This meant that she would not only have to care for her master and senior disciple, but also extend care to her family and friends, and extend universal love to all people. Ah, she still had such a long way to go. Nothing for it, then — she'd hang on for a bit longer during spear practice tomorrow, and write one extra page into her calligraphy copybook too."

        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Details</color>\nShenhe was originally from a branch family of exorcists, but due to a series of coincidences, she became the disciple of an adeptus.\nShe is a student solely of Cloud Retainer in name, but her impressive constitution and intelligence quickly won several other adepti over.\nShe would go on to learn from them all, eventually becoming a master of adeptal arts in her own right as a mortal.\nShe very much looks the part as well in her unique temperament and manner of carrying herself — indeed, it would be no understatement to name her a true adeptus upon meeting her for the first time.\nHowever, it is precisely due to the long years of tutelage that she has lacked company save for the adepti and odd passing illuminated beast.\nThis isolation has caused her to grow distant and indifferent.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 2</color>\nShenhe is in all likelihood the least accustomed to mortal life amongst those who take on an adeptal appearance.\nHaving been sequestered in the mountains since a young age, she lacks experience and common sense, which makes it difficult for her to relate to people normally.\nTo ordinary people, there are many solutions to any given problem. But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.\nFor example, she almost never considers \"negotiation\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \"threats\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?\nShe has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.\nFor example: Why do we need to pay for food?\nIs there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?\nShe even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.\nIn a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.\nMuch like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.\nMountain Shaper once had this to say about her:\n\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\"\n\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\"\n\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 3</color>\nLiyue has no lack of folktales about meetings with the adepti, and many of these concern relative nobodies whom an adeptus took under their wing, thus elevating them greatly.\nHowever, the circumstances under which Shenhe's fate became tied to the adeptal abodes was no such glorious thing. If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.\nWhen she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.\nOver time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.\nHe left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.\nAt last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.\nHer father had brought with him a secret art known as \"Fate Transference\"—\nBy making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.\nAt that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.\nHe claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...\nBut the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.\nHer father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \"seelie\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.\nStupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.\nCrises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.\nThis creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!\nGripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \"seelie,\" trembling yet resolute...\nSeveral days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.\nTaking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.\nIf not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.\n<color=#ffd780>White Jade Comb</color>\nOnce upon a time, Shenhe had a full head of black hair.\nWhen she was first brought to Mt. Hulao, she would not say a word. The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.\nIt was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.\nCloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.\nThe adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.\nShenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.\nOn the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.\nWhen the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.\n...\nToday, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.\nThrough her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:\nThe first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret."

But during our journey together, I feel I have finally grasped the key to all of this.

Together with other Adepti, they defended their people.\nA long, long time ago, before the Archon War, there was a severe drought in Liyue. Left with no choice, many people left their homes, while others spent day and night praying to the Adepti. On top of the drought, a noxious gas also began to spread through the land. If not for Cloud Retainer's efforts, much of Liyue would be nothing more than a barren wasteland today. Upon arrival, the Adeptus borrowed the wind to retain the clouds. Immediately, the clouds gathered together, and abundant rain burst forth from the heavens. Drought and plague were both driven away, and the people of Liyue were saved."

Cloud Retainer often laughed at the cups that Rex Lapis brought because they were too square. She was also friends with Fujin and Herblord, the Adepti of the north, who served another goddess.\nGuizhong, Cloud Retainer's friend, also often held meetings in the Guili Assembly, reserving seats around the largest stone table for them. Marchosius would bring his delectable dishes to the table, Sea Gazer would always bring out his latest treasure, and Cloud Retainer and Guizhong would discuss their latest inventions. Streetward Rambler would often remain to admire the flowers with Guizhong before returning to her own abode. Guizhong would always find topics for conversation, filling the table with humor and laughter.\nOnce Moon Carver and Cloud Retainer participated in a race. After Moon Carver lost, he insisted that Cloud Retainer's ability to fly gave her a natural edge in such a contest. She agreed to forgo flying in return for being able to use one of her devices, \"Bi-Cyclical Thunderflash-Mobile,\" in the race. Thanks to the Adeptal energy, the mobile could travel up thousands of miles in one day, but its weakness was against mountainous terrain. As Cloud Retainer overtook Moon Carver, the device went off the track a few seconds before the finish line, resulting in the defeat of the race. Another time, it snowed heavily in Liyue, and Mt. Aocang was covered in several feet of snow. Cloud Retainer created a Snowdrift Mechanism for skiing in the mountains. Together with Guizhong and Streetward Rambler, she had a tremendous time, until Moon Carver decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snowbank. It took them hours to dig him up."

Marchosius sacrificed himself for the people, losing his powers and memory and turning into Guoba. Guizhong was killed and her powers were sealed. Skybracer sacrificed his antlers to support a collapsing mountain, ensuring the safety of villagers, and kept on fighting until his blood was drained and his life ran out. In the Sea of Liyue, stone lances, thrown by Morax, formed the Guyun Stone Forest, where the defeated Archons were buried and sealed.\nMany legends are told about the feats of Cloud Retainer during the Archon War. One legend says that the surviving mortals, who had lost everything in the tumult, fled to the mountains, and there they begged the Adepti for shelter. They were pursued by countless monsters who had long since lost their senses. After several days of fierce battle, with everything hanging in the balance, some say, Cloud Retainer burst from the clouds like a descending gale. She turned the tide and defeated the monsters. There are other versions of this legend, but in each legend, Cloud Retainer heroically saved the people of Liyue.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

She initially made a lot of gardening and landscaping machines for her friend Madame Ping to look after the Silk Flowers on the terrace and called them Bloom Pruners. The Bloom Pruner can transform into the shape of any creature to blend into its environment. When Madame Ping learned that her old friend Guoba was participating in the Arataki Beetle Brawl, she gave Guoba a Bloom Pruner and got it to take the form of an Onikabuto. During the battle with Arataki Itto's Crimson Staff, the Bloom Pruner showed such skill using only one-thousandth of his strength that Itto wanted to become a disciple of Cloud Retainer in order to learn such skill."

Cloud Retainer saw the boy and decided that her young disciple, Shuyu, should spend more time with people her own age. While walking along Liyue Harbor, she noticed that Shuyu's peers had friends with whom they could have fun in their free time. But Mt. Aocang is not a bustling city of mortals, there are no children her age nearby, and so there was sometimes a concern that she was suffering from loneliness. The Adeptus had only recently taught the girl about the principles of mechanics, so Hanakado's training would allow her to consolidate her knowledge better. Cloud Retainer designed a second mechanical Onikabuto and a special subspace in the teapot — an annex of an Adeptal realm that she split off to improve Bloom Pruner's gardening functions. The monsters inside are all targets created using Adeptal energy and act in set ways similar to those of the creatures they're based on.\nIn addition to creating mechanisms, Cloud Retainer likes to study and disassemble existing ones. One day, during the Lantern Rite Festival, Keqing gave the Adeptus a new firework designed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Cloud Retainer was delighted with the gift since it was a device with an original design, aesthetically pleasing to the eye.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

Then she could not change her appearance, but the Master, having learned about her dream, prepared a special Human Mimicry Potion to give her disciple a human appearance for ten years. So the crane became a human, receiving the name Yuandai. Ten years later, she had to return to her real appearance so as not to lose her memory and not turn into an incomprehensible entity, neither human, beast, nor Adeptus, but Yuandai met her love and decided to remain human. When her time was up, she became very ill and lost her memory, but Cloud Retainer made her a special potion from her blood to eliminate the symptoms.\nWhen 50 years later Yuandai lost her memory again, Cloud Retainer met with her and her granddaughter, Shuyu, and helped her regain her memories. In order to prevent Yuandai from turning into a monster, the Adeptus returned her to the form of a crane and took Shuyu as her disciple.

Cloud Retainer took this all in but did not disturb the girl, instead making a comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her. The Adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter Adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship. Shenhe did exactly as the Adeptus said without any hesitation, and her black hair turned frosty silver. Through her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes: the first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret."

        "text": "At first sight, Cloud Retainer does not like the company of people and prefers to spend time alone, creating and studying various mechanisms in her abode. She can sometimes be abrupt and rude to strangers. But if you get to know her better, it turns out that she loves to talk, especially about Ganyu, a half-human, half-Qilin whom Cloud Retainer has known since Ganyu's childhood. Cloud Retainer loves to tell stories about little Ganyu when she was chubby and couldn't sleep unless her horns were stroked. Despite her harshness, Cloud Retainer cares for her fellow Adepti, whom she likes to call fossils, as well as Ganyu, her disciple Shenhe, and Streetward Rambler's disciple Yaoyao. She asks those around them and themselves to look out for each other. Ganyu even personally introduced Shenhe to her employer, Chef Mao from Wanmin Restaurant.\nCloud Retainer often pretends that she does not need the company and that she can talk to herself for days on end and not get bored. In fact, sometimes she gets very lonely. Nearly all her dear friends who once laughed by her side have perished in the raging fires of the Archon War. Sometimes, the emptiness inside her is quite overwhelming. And though her companions sacrificed themselves willingly in defense of the world, she cannot help but lament their passing. Cloud Retainer also misses her disciples who live in Liyue Harbor. The Adepti often expects them to visit and is afraid to visit herself, so as not to create inconvenience at work.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
