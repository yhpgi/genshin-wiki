Whenever she wants to, she possesses Oz and looks down upon the earth from the sky.\nWhether she wants to inspect the flora on the Stormbearer Mountains or observe a disturbance in Wolvendom, through Oz she can see anything and everything.\nThanks largely to her unique ability — and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality — Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization.\nShe's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.\nThen again, would they really have had to do much persuading? If she's the Prinzessin der Verurteilung... one can only assume that would make them the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung."

O, ye servants who long for the blessing of the prinzessin; venture now deep into the battlefield with hearts of the tiger\" means that the initial investigative work has been completed;\n\"All has been written in this tome of dark prophecies\" simply means that her journal has been updated with the latest reports.\nHowever, the \"Fischl Dictionary\" is actually just an in-joke, not a real book.\nThose who are familiar with Fischl concentrate on what she means to say, not the way in which she says it; she notices this and takes it as a sign of true respect.\n\"Aha! So you do understand. Then fate does indeed bring kindred spirits together.\"\nThose who manage to adopt her speech mannerisms when they respond to her will find she is both delighted and bashful, and praises their language-learning ability.\n\"A prinzessin should always give praise where praise is due...

A long time ago in a place far, far away, there was a tiny little girl.\nThe girl's parents were busy adventurers. She spent most of her childhood in the library, traversing the countless universes that were contained in the pages of the library books.\nShe became the ruler of the Immernachtreich, summoned Thundering Retribution as a royal princess, and formed a soul bond with a Raven...\n...\n\"███, what books did you read today?\" Her parents asked her on one of the rare occasions that they were home between adventures.\nShe proceeded to tell them the story she had read from her favorite series.\n\"...And then he said, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, you are the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'\"\n\"Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, ███, how about I call you \"Fischl\" too?\" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her.\n\"Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.\"\nThese kind and loving words lit up her world.\nHowever, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.\nUnable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:\n\"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...\"\n\"Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage.\""

My parents will understand,\" she thought to herself.\nFor if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.\nBut when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation.\n\"███, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...\"\nAnd with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.\nThat day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings.\nSure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world.\nWhat transpired afterwards is another story...\nFischl doesn't much like this story. Thinking about it causes her to feel suffocating pain and soul-devouring loneliness.\nMaybe one day, this story will be written. But that would be ███'s story, not Fischl's.\nFischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin.\nAs long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.\nThings are looking up for Prinzessin Fischl these days — not only does she have Oz, but she has finally met a traveler who, just like her, comes from a different world..."

Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.\nThe Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.\nAfter all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these."

Follow me unto eternity.\"\n\"For I am the noblest soul in all the Immernachtreich. So long as my heart beats, I shall never forsake you.\"\nAnd the knights obeyed her:\n\"Our swords and armor are yours. May they be for you a means to break all shackles and guard against all corruption.\"\n\"Our true hearts also we give unto you, that they may defend your noble soul.\"\nThis was their knightly oath, and they would be by her side as she hunted the wicked dragon Tasraque.\nFor far away, black-hearted Tasraque had ripped and devoured the all-protecting night sky and set up its lair.\nIt had slithered in the dark, sharpening its fangs and claws, and with its flaming breath it had scorched the Prinzessin's heart, turning her eyes red.\nThis was the Prinzessin's fated foe, and their showdown was inevitable.\nBut the prophecy of fate has already been foretold. Fair and pure souls need not fret.\nSimple open one's eyes and prepare to bear witness, for she shall surely return victorious.\n-Curtains Fall-\nNote: According to Flowers for Princess Fischl, Princess Fischl has \"crimson eyes like rubies.\" The actor who plays her is thus advised to make the necessary performative adjustments to maintain faithfulness to the source material."
