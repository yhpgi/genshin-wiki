            "text": "In the calm waters of Cider Lake, the fish of Mondstadt were enjoying quiet, happy lives...\nBut then, a never-before-seen army of Spikey Fish appeared. They were clad in strange armor and carried small, short swords. Ferocious and oppressive, they soon took over the homes of the local fish.\n\"Haha! This belongs to the Spikey Fish Kings now!\"\nTo reclaim their homeland and eject the invaders, the fish of Mondstadt asked the strong and imaginative Dodoco and the cheerful and kind Spark Knight for help...\n\"Jumpy... Eh? We can't use Jumpy Dumpty this time?\"\nThe powerful Jumpy Dumpty bomb would destroy the houses the fish were trying to reclaim, and the lakebed would be utterly wrecked. Another idea was needed.\nThe clever Dodoco and the Spark Knight discussed the problem at length, and came up with the \"Super-Special, Super-Safe, Super-Reliable Jumpy Dumpty\" — small and precise enough to blow up only the bad Spikey Fish, leaving the innocent fishies unharmed.\nBut the name — \"Super-Special, Super-Safe, Super-Reliable Jumpy Dumpty\" — was a little long, and the Spark Knight kept saying it wrong. So, they called the new device the \"Special Jumpy Dumpty\" instead!\n\"Wait! Allow me to listen out...\"\nIt turned out that Dodoco's long ears weren't just for show. They were great for picking up sounds!\nOnce thrown into the lake, Special Jumpy Dumpties would swim toward wherever the Spikey Fish were active, and Dodoco could hear it all!\nThat allowed the Special Jumpy Dumpties to work their magic at exactly the right spot, defeating the Spikey Fish!\nBut the enemy seemed prepared. There were so many of them! The Spark Knight and Dodoco rushed back and forth, not even stopping to eat. They were almost out of Special Jumpy Dumpties!\n\"You think you two are enough to beat us, conquerors of the five seas!?\"\nBut what were the \"five seas\" the Spikey Fish spoke of? Could they have overpowered the fish in other places as well?\nFlummoxed, Dodoco and the Spark Knight returned to the Athenaeum to inquire with the \"Scribe Witch.\"\nWithout needing to crack open a book, the witch chuckled softly:\n\"Perhaps these 'five seas' simply refer to the north, east, south, west, and center of Cider Lake.\"\nIt finally dawned on the Spark Knight and Dodoco — they'd fallen for a fish story!\nUnfortunately, the slippery Spike Fishes had seized this opportunity to construct a sturdy barrier reef. They then expertly hid among the aquatic plants, kicking off a devious game of hide-and-seek with Dodoco and the Spark Knight...\nNow these thorny fishies would be an even greater thorn in their sides!\nDodoco and the Spark Knight thus called in help — the Honorary Knight and the Helper in White. With ample experience between them, the two offered just the advice they needed.\nLooking at a map, the Honorary Knight said:\n\"Just like with any adventure, you must first determine the direction in which to advance.\"\nDodoco understood — by finding a way to control the direction of the blast, they could enhance the Special Jumpy Dumpties' power and reach Spikey Fish further away!\nBetween mouthfuls of dessert, the Helper in White said:\n\"And if you can make the explosions take all sorts of forms, they'll be even harder to evade!\"\nThe Spark Knight then had an idea: If they made the Special Jumpy Dumpty explode into the shapes of different desserts, they could lure the gluttonous Spikey Fish and wipe them out in one blast!\nSo, Dodoco and the Spark Knight upgraded the Special Jumpy Dumpty with a new ability.\nThis new-and-improved Special Jumpy Dumpty could explode in various shapes that could pass through the lake plants and reach the enemy soldiers hiding in even the trickiest locations.\nEven if they couldn't deal with the unyielding stones, they could circumvent them — delivering an explosive surprise to the nasty fish behind it.\nArmed with these Special Jumpy Dumpties, Dodoco and the Spark Knight no longer had to worry about being ambushed by the Spikey Fish!\nOne after another, the Spikey Fish were defeated. When word of this finally reached the Spikey Fish Kings, they swelled up angrily and stormed in to join the battle!\nIn the Honorary Knight and the Helper in White's experience, bulbous blobs were always bad news!\nWhen they looked over to the opposing side and saw the hulking Kings, glimmering in gold, they wondered — how were there suddenly so many of them?\nNo matter how they sliced it, this was all rather fishy...\nBetween mouthfuls of dessert, the Helper in White said:\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of! Maybe these Kings just used berries to paint themselves gold!\"\nLooking at a map, the Honorary Knight said:\n\"Even if they dyed themselves with Nilotpala Lotuses, their strength would only increase by 50%. At the end of the day, a fish is still a fish!\"\nIndeed, to them, \"King\" might have been more like a title, something that looked impressive and intimidating to others. Their golden color did not necessarily mean that they were any stronger!\nThe Spark Knight and Dodoco breathed sighs of relief — Now they wouldn't need to school these fish late into the night and make everyone worry by returning home so late!\nThey'd reached the home stretch. It was time to make quick work of this puzzle!\nEmboldened by their kings, the soldiers mounted another defense amidst the stones and aquatic plants. They were undaunted!\nDodoco, the Spark Knight, the Honorary Knight, and the Helper in White had to come up with a clever countermeasure — how should they deploy their limited number of Special Jumpy Dumpties to defeat all their foes in just a few blasts...?\nThe Spark Knight glanced over at the Helper in White, who was circling the Honorary Knight, and thought of something...\n\"Wait a minute, if these Spikey Fish only know how to defend against Special Jumpy Dumpties from the front, then all we need to do is go around them, right?\"\nThe Spikey Fish could only move in the water, but the Spark Knight and Dodoco could freely walk around the pond's edge to where they were undefended, and then launch their Special Jumpy Dumpties from there!\nWith smart, precise blasts, the Spikey Fish were completely blown out of the water and sent scattered away in defeat!\nDuring their retreat, they even retrieved their things, leaving not one bit of trash in Cider Lake!\nDodoco, the Special Jumpy Dumpty, the Spark Knight, the Honorary Knight, and the Helper in White had thus defended Cider Lake together. Life was going swimmingly for the fish of Mondstadt once more!\nTo reward themselves for their hard work, Dodoco, the Special Jumpy Dumpties, the Spark Knight, the Honorary Knight, and the Helper in White rolled out a tablecloth and heartily enjoyed a lakeside picnic.\nOn the menu was Mint Jelly, Caramel Cookies, Berry Cake and Tomato Chili — a sweet, spicy, and refreshing spread!\nThe threat to Cider Lake was now quelled — Dodoco and the Spark Knight had saved the day!\nAnd who knows? Perhaps the fruit of this strange encounter — the creation of the Special Jumpy Dumpties — might come in handy again someday!"
