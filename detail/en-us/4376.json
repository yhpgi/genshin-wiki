People who stand on the stage basking in the adulation of their audience must also bear the pressures of being in the public eye and living up to everyone's expectations. But I knew very well my person wouldn't be enough, and that putting on the act of a god would be able the only way to satisfy their adoration... And at the end of the day, all I ever experienced was loneliness. So there came a point when I loathed the very thought of acting and locked myself in my room. It wasn't until the moment I stood on stage and faced the audience again that I realized the anxiety in my heart had dissipated. The reason I can now stand before the crowd's watchful gaze is perhaps because... I have finally started to act as myself.</p>",

I imagine that this is good for both of us, right?</p>",

In my efforts to maintain the reserved manner of a deity, I never got the chance to enjoy my life, which is why I've become obsessed with shopping lately. I've bought many new precious things... like dazzling rainbow-colored tea bags, fully-automated extendable cutlery, and a saddle specially made for riding Seahorses... But in the end, I realized that most of the stuff I bought was useless, so I sent them all to the troupe to be used as props in performances. Strange... before I bought those things, I was certain they would all be of good use to me...</p>",

They also love to talk about the future, as if they're willing to sacrifice everything for an uncertain tomorrow. I don't agree with their way of thinking, yet I also feel very envious... I once lived in a world without a past or a future. To cope with that anxiety, I tried to create and act out a stronger, more god-like version of myself. Over the centuries, the stronger role I tried to play gradually merged with my real self. Even I can't separate the two now... but perhaps there's no need to distinguish them. Experiences of the past have formed who I am now, and that flawed performance has also become the most important part of me.</p>",

And who does not wish for an eternal spring?\nSpring is transient, but she is ever there — follow the stage lights, and you shall see her."

Should the mood strike her, she will agree to appear, resulting in a stage shared by a god and humans.\nOnce Furina has agreed to participate, the performance date for that show becomes a Fontainian festival in its own right, so popular that the Opera Epiclese couldn't possibly meet the fervent demand even if they sold nothing but standing tickets and were filled to capacity.\nAnd when the music sounds and a god takes the stage, the audience will see not their lovable deity, who does as she pleases, but the character in the script.\nWhether majestic or valiant, conniving or covetous, Furina is a dab hand at playing them all, perfect down to the last gesture, as if she were born to act.\nAnd it is because of her record of wondrous performances that she very much deserves to be called \"superstar\" by her people.\nEven a famous reporter from The Steambird who had barely squeaked their way backstage was completely awestruck, such that it was a long while before they remembered the interview questions in their notebook.\n\"Lady Furina, might I ask how you were able to attain such great mastery acting as an Archon, though no one has ever seen you practice?\"\nFurina's reply was proud, albeit uncharacteristically simple. \"Why, because I am a god. Next question!\""

For one who always finds herself interacting with humans like Furina, this serves as an excellent change of pace.\nHowever, animal habits are inconsistent and unpredictable, and Furina's carefree attitude always seems to rub them the wrong way. As in the \"if she's not being blasted in the face by Hat Jellyfish, then she's being pursued to the ends of the ocean by Hunter's Rays\" kind of wrong way.\nIt can be argued that the underwater world is more primitive and wild than the surface world, considering how little respect the animals here give a god on account of her status alone.\nNonetheless, Furina did eventually discover the animal for her ministrations — the sunbathing, beach-loving, horizontal alignment-enjoying Blubberbeasts.\nCheek squeezes, belly rubs, and even flipping them over, then over again, gets at most a turn of the head and noiseless protest.\n\"Hmm? You like it? Hehe, so do I!\"\nA few mild miscommunications aside, they have since become the best of friends."

You didn't seem interested in my opinions, so I arranged to perform with a different troupe.\"\nThe director was stunned. He had planned for Furina to discover the \"flaws\" in her view only after setup was complete.\nBut he could already tell that the stage sections that had been constructed precisely in accordance with her directions were significantly superior. Ordinary audience members couldn't necessarily tell, of course, but to professionals, the difference was always in the details, and these were obvious at a glance.\nStill, this director was unwilling to simply turn back, criticizing Furina for not adhering to the spirit of contractual obligation by not informing them beforehand of her contingency arrangements.\nFurina would not let this villain cast the first stone, instead scrunching her face into an expression of disbelief.\n\"You don't really think I'm that much of a gullible fool, do you? Guards! Send them on their way.\""

No matter how small, once it appeared, it would be irreversible.\nAnd the consequences of being exposed would be to reduce all her long years of work to dust, to allow Fontaine to fall — that was unconscionable!\nSo she did her best to laugh loudly when she should be glad, and weep bitterly when she should grieve, and display the divine bearing of an Archon when it was time to show off, all without fail, all without rest.\nShe knew that this was a performance. If she could endure until the danger had passed, she could finally take off her mask and regain the freedom to express her feelings.\nYet, she slowly began to realize that the godly role she was playing was eating into her.\nA horrifying doubt began to creep up on her — how should she react when glad, if not to laugh loudly?\nPerhaps she was once a girl who did not much enjoy laughter. Perhaps she had once been the sort to give up on herself at the first sign of difficulty, but such emotions had already slipped away, bit by bit.\nThose in the performance arts often say that one must become a character to play them.\nFrom that perspective, Furina's performance as the Hydro Archon has been flawless. Her painstaking perseverance produced the perfect product.\nBut no one has ever spoken of what might transpire once the last light had dimmed, for to them, the stage is fleeting.\nFor one such as Furina, who has acted for far too long, even the path back offstage has faded into dust, buried by the sands of time."

The affected areas were gradually rebuilt, and the people held high hopes for the future.\nFurina was the only one with no place in this new world. She was quick to pack her bags and leave the Palais Mermonia, nor did she return to the Opera Epiclese.\nShe simply wanted to leave the memories that brought her so much pain as far behind as possible, and she was uninterested in the debates surrounding her — the Hydro Archon's tale was over, as it should be.\nBut where should an actress who had finished her part and fulfilled her duty go? None could say, and the concept of \"freedom\" rang hollow.\nFurina's luggage remained piled up in her new rental apartment, and she lacked all will even to tidy up or get moved in. All she could do was lie in bed and stare at the bare ceiling.\nThose she knew had very quickly found their place in the new order. Whether due to their strength, duties, or friendships, their importance made them irreplaceable.\nIn circumstances such as these, didn't \"free\" simply mean being someone who no one needed?\nJust as she had reached this conclusion, her new residence received its first guest — Clorinde the Champion Duelist.\nThe duelist was shocked at Furina's living conditions, quickly expressing her willingness to pay for better accommodations, a notion Furina expended no small amount of effort disabusing her of. Despite this, she was dragged, however reluctantly, into at least properly unpacking and tidying up the room.\nClorinde then explained that she was here to invite Furina to a gathering. The duelist rarely took part in social events, but this gathering was one of old friends, who, as it happened, also knew Furina, and whom Clorinde had not seen in a while, anyway, so she thought she'd extend an invitation.\nIn days past, Furina would certainly have refused, for the greater the intimacy of her association with others, the more difficult it would be to conceal her true identity.\nThe duelist smiled as Furina guiltily lifted her eyes, having seemingly already guessed the latter's feelings as well as her old reasons for snubbing such events.\n\"I don't suppose you have any reason to refuse now, do you?\"\n\"Well... I'm not very good at this sort of thing, so, um... Don't you think I'd, you know, be a bit of a wet blanket?\"\nThat night, Furina finally got to experience what it was like to revel and drink with friends. In truth, she was cautious at first but was restored to her normal self within two cups — indeed, so much so that at one point Clorinde had to restrain her from leaping onto the table.\nFor someone as reticent as the duelist, the real Furina's explosiveness was quite the surprise.\nAs for Furina, she still knew not where to go, but if nothing else, she now knew that \"freedom\" did not mean solitude."

Time passed quietly, and one day, they were told by the gentilhomme that the Master was about to visit, and so the servants hurriedly began to prepare.\nThe banquet was akin to a festival, and laughter and cheer filled every corner of the mansion — at least, until the Master was late the second day, and upon investigating, the maid was to discover his already-cold corpse.\nThe Gardes narrowed the suspects down to the servants, but the maid, convinced that the Master's death had something to do with the mansion's secret, at last decided to open that forbidden gate.\nTo her surprise, what awaited her on the other side was the mansion's main hall, upon the central stairs of which stood the all-too-familiar surintendante of the house. The words she spoke, too, were bizarrely known to the maid.\n\"Ah, you must be our newest applicant. Crabaletta, I believe?\"\nFurina was quite dumbfounded when she read that, for the story here recalled similar events in her memories.\nShe admired the happy lives of the maid and the other servants, and the maid's courage in facing down the ancient secret to defend that life.\nLater, Furina dreamt of that same mansion. In her dream, she was Crabaletta, huffing and puffing as she ran to that door of secrets, and, with one deep breath, pushed it open.\nBehind it was a torrent of seawater that drowned the mansion in an instant, dissolving all in its wake — the Gardes, the surintendante of the house, the gentilhomme, and even herself.\nFurina woke with a start, looking around her to gather her wits, and the rest of the story sprang to her mind, unbidden...\nCrabaletta made use of the time loop triggered by opening the door to solve the mystery of the Master's death and discover the mansion's secret, freeing all its inhabitants from an ancient curse.\n\"Thank you, Crabaletta.\"\nShe thanked the brave, stalwart girl for giving that tale a happy ending.\nAnd as for several vivid figures from the story, they would eventually be given lovely forms, that they might be by Furina's side."
