            "text": "This flower, carved from flint and Drakite, was left in Cinder City. It is a talisman passed down through generations by beast tamers from the Scions of the Canopy.\nA flint paw print adorns the item, said to have been made by the first Yumkasaurus to bond with a human.\nThe beast tamers are those who focus on building friendships with Saurians. Their ideals are sometimes incomprehensible even to their fellow tribespeople,\nFor they seek to settle matters peacefully even with violent Saurians who have hurt a human, even attempting to beat the Saurian Hunters to the punch.\n\"There is a way to gain the trust of even the most vicious Saurian — all that is needed is enough patience.\"\nThis was the wisdom the young beast tamer received from his master alongside this weighty talisman, and he kept it in his heart.\n\"Beasts, too, have the same hearts as we do.\" So he believed, and so kept faith, until the world-engulfing black tide came.\nThose were monsters who could never be understood, beasts with whom peace could never be made.\nWhen he finally returned to his hometown, all he saw were dreams ripped to shreds by monstrous claws running amok.\nSettling the tribespeople fortunate enough to survive, the beast tamer, no longer young, embarked on a journey from which there could be no return.\nThis time, his foes were the heartless demons that came in with that dark tide, and dealing with them, too, required patience.\nFor only patience could ensure that not one of them was left to plague the land he held dear.\nLegends hold that the ancient Python King once forged a secret, Abyss-repelling treasure that could only be retrieved from the filth-ridden ancient city.\nPerhaps such was simply the wishful thinking of those who dwelled deep in despair, but for the brave, this hope was yet worth a try.\nAt the end of his journey, the warrior bereft of his home would reach the burned-out city, and there come face to face with a secret long buried."

Come on, Liriwu, pull yourself together...\"\nCarrying new hope in her heart, she set out on another path — upon a homeward road for all."

To prove that his research was not utterly useless,\nHe would also make some items, with this strangely shaped beast-claw goblet being his pride and joy.\nAt that time, he had yet to realize how much of a luxury all this pointless study was.\nWhen dark nightmares devoured homes, all the woven scrolls they worked so hard to find were destroyed in the fires of war.\nHis daily routine, to which he was long used, evaporated as if he had awakened from a quiet afternoon nap,\nAnd destiny pushed him onto another path, and in this he no longer had any choice.\nHe had once read in the oldest scrolls that the ruins left by the ancient dragons contained weapons capable of defending against the demons.\nSo, to prevent his comrades from dying in vain, he put his past research aside, dedicating the rest of his life to a new cause.\nThe machines of the secret source excavated from those abandoned ruins were restructured and modified to aid the warriors.\nPerhaps it was the knowledge accumulated over the years, or perhaps it was some wise sage's guiding hand behind the scenes, but the project went incredibly smoothly,\nUntil, at last, in the depths of a forsaken city, he discovered a secret — or perhaps a curse — that had been hidden for thousands of years.\nLegends held that the Python King of Ochkanatlan once built a sky-faring treasure ship,\nAnd that within this ship was a secret prize that could drive the Abyss beyond the bounds of the world.\nSuch legends became a balm to those eking out survival in such desolate times,\nAnd a beacon to countless adventurers who embarked on lengthy journeys to save the world.\nNot one who ventured forth returned, making the scholar a target for public scorn,\nYet he kept faith that this was no lie, that this was a truth he had witnessed with his very own eyes.\nSome say he meant to prove his point, or perhaps he meant to end all this,\nBut the traveling scholar, at last, joined a team of adventurers, heading toward the city up in the clouds."

Perhaps this was how the rest of his life would play out — for how could he have known of the imminent catastrophe then?\nIt began as mere dark clouds roiling on the horizon, then sporadic reports of people disappearing in the night realm... and when the monsters appeared before them,\nNone were ready.\nNonetheless, someone had to shoulder the responsibility, and the strong naturally should bear a greater burden.\nIt was only after witnessing true war that he first felt the weight of destiny.\nThus did he bid his wife and unborn child farewell, and he became himself a fearsome demon on the battlefield,\nFor to vanquish demons and monsters, one must become more ferocious still.\nThat was the last battle of his life, and as he collapsed amidst the pool of blood atop the apex of the Cinder City, countless scenes flashed before his eyes.\nHe glimpsed the fiery red flames of the ancient land bloom before them once more like fields of flowers upon the plains,\n\"The gates of hell are stained red by the flowing blood of the brave. Let me offer my blood, and leave the key to those gates with my child.\"\nOr perhaps what he saw was the faint light through the crack in that gate, at the last reminding him of the words he said to his beloved wife as they parted.\n\"...If it's a girl, call her Bona.
