Just a bit of a daze...\n<color=#ffffff>Big Guy?:</color>\n...\n...Hrooo... Rrooo...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nIs that your desire, or...?\n(Reach out to the dying beast...)\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat are you doing... Err...\nTraveler, you...!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Transform into the Saurian</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhy's the big guy so energetic, all of a sudden...? Wait, is that you, Traveler? You're... inside its body? Uhh, this better not be some kind of strange dream...\nSo how about we just... rescue that little guy first?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Shatter the rock and rescue the whelp</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Speak to the young creature</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAh... Are you alright there, little guy?\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWh—What's wrong? You don't look so good. Is it your tail? Did you injure it when you fell from that barrier?\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nIf only we could bandage it...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, it's Paimon's time to shine! Your backpack's so full that even when it's an emergency, it still takes all day to find anything.\nLet's use this scarf from Paimon's Emergency Backpack instead!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nI have no clue where that backpack of yours is even supposed to be...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmph! Somewhere secret, somewhere safe, of course...\nAnyway, do you wanna use the scarf or not?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nWe'll use it. Thank you kindly, Paimon.\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nErrr?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAlright, little guy, don't move...\nHehe. Our little guy sure is well behaved, eh, Traveler?\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nThat should do the trick.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAlright. Feel better now?\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRoar...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, looks way better now. That's a relief... Still, how did you end up in that barrier? And those Rifthounds...\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nErrr?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo you don't know either, huh. Now, we don't really get what you're saying... But now that we've rescued you, you can go home.\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nEhrrr?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWait, do you not know where your home is?\nWhat about relatives, then? ...Oh, wait... That big guy from earlier...\nWhat do we do, Traveler? We can't just leave it here all by itself, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nWrroh...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nIt might be better if you stay with us for a while...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah, that makes sense. Maybe we'll find this little guy's family when we reach Natlan... But we've never seen anything like it...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nAh. \"Chosen of... Dragons...\" Could that mean...?\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh. You mean you heard something like that?\nNow that Paimon thinks about it, Natlan is the \"nation of dragons\"... So, does that mean that... wait, they call little guys like this 'Saurians' around here, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawoo...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nCome to think of it, Paimon does see some resemblance to vishaps. Y'know... Two legs, one tail, and all.\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRraaa?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nWe're happy to have it travel with us...\nBut we should ask our friend here if that's what it wants to do first.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nTrue, true. Hey there, little guy. Would you like to travel with us?\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\n...\nRrawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe! Looks like we're all agreed then. Anyway, Paimon's Paimon, and he's/she's Traveler!\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nWrraa? Rawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOh, yeah, you need a name too... Let Paimon think. Right! Since you're yellow and brown all over, let's call you \"Hash Brown\"!\n<color=#ffffff>Hash Brown?:</color>\nRroooo... Rraaaa...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>I suspect that would only go down well at Good Hunter...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYou mean people wouldn't like it anywhere else?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Looks like it doesn't like that name...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRroo...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWould you like Traveler to give you a name, then? Well... not that Paimon can vouch for his/her naming sense, though.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>All the names I've come up with so far have been perfectly normal, I'll have you know.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Poor little thing... to suffer such a calamitous fate.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Give the little one an awesome new name!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo, what should we call this little guy?\nGive the name \"Paimon\"\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo, no, this name won't do at all!\nGive the Traveler's nickname\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nErr, are you going to give it the same name as you, Traveler?\nGive the name \"Hashbrown\"\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nEh? You didn't like it when Paimon said \"Hash Brown,\" but Traveler calls you \"Hash Brown\" and now you're all happy and stuff? ...Ugh, never mind. No point being mad at you.\nGive the name \"Littleone\"\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm, Littleone isn't a bad name either... and it's a name Paimon came up with too, right?\nGive the name of certain powerful Dragons or figures\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm, this name feels like it's piling the pressure on... Let's go with something else, Traveler!\nGive the name of certain famous kaijuus\n<color=#ffffff>Little Guy?:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nOoh, there's some real power behind that name!\nGive an appropriate name\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nThen let's call this little fella \"appropriate name\", shall we?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Let's go with that!</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAlright, hehe!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Let me think about this some more...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAlright. Names are important, after all, so give it all the thought you need!\nSo, what should we call this little guy?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to your Saurian companion</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> You've made a new friend! Travel together with Little One during your stay in Natlan.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nLittle One. That'll be your name from now on, little guy!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nLittle One...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\n...Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nLooks like our little friend loves this name! Well, with any luck, we'll solve the mystery that surrounds you while we're in Natlan... Ah, and maybe we'll get some clues as to why Traveler was able to suddenly enter that Saurian's body...\nOh yeah, are you okay, by the way, Traveler? You suddenly turned into a Saurian back there... Are you feeling uncomfortable anyway?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Oh, just a little Saurian-sick.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhat's that even supposed to mean!? This isn't the time for jokes!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Becoming a Saurian for a bit was alright.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWell, it'd best stay that way! Things could go south real fast if some day you were to turn into a Saurian and be unable to transform back...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nStill, Traveler, Paimon's never heard of anyone in Natlan who can turn into a Saurian... This is kinda weird.\nSeriously, we only just got here, and it feels like so much has already happened... Anyway, how do we get outta here?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm? You know where the exit is?\nLittle One runs off.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, hey! Don't just suddenly go running off like that...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Follow your Saurian companion</color>\n<color=#ffffff73>Optional Dialogue: Talk to Little One</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Ehrr... Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Leave the strange space</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAh, we're back here... Strange... the shining pillars from before are gone!\nHmm... Paimon's heard that there's a place called the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, and it's a major hub in Natlan. Maybe someone there might know what's happened to Little One.\nLet's head there if we get the chance, shall we?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!"
