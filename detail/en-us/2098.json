Hence, illusory visions were born out of concrete reality.\"\n\"The so-called omamori cannot make one's wishes come true at all, but they can make them eternal through this entanglement.\"\nThe Lady Kitsune couldn't help but break out into laughter upon seeing my clueless expression.\nShe cheerfully knocked my head with her pipe and sneakily changed the subject.\n\"I suppose you've met your fated one as well, Hibiki?\"\n\"What sort of 'fate' could there be with a rude and reckless brute like that!\"\n\"Oh, is that so?\"\nBut darkness engulfed everything in the end.\nThat \"fate,\" too, was no more."

And time keeps moving like a spinning wheel.\nSilent and tranquil, the Lady Kitsune's white form hidden in the deep darkness left a deep impression in the shrine maiden's dreams.\nThe Great Tengu went into self-imposed exile, enraged at her own incompetence as the Lady Saiguu's protector, leaving Teruyo behind.\nHarunosuke left for another country amid the fury of his mourning, while Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to clear the Mikoshi name.\nAs for the man who taught me archery in the sacred forest and patiently listened to my naïve promise under the scarlet sakura boughs,\nHe will eventually return to me, even if he were to be blinded by splattered blood, or turned into a fierce beast by that dark defilement...\nI shall save him with our bow and arrows, to keep our promise, which ever veers towards breaking.\nI shall destroy evil with our bow and arrows, exorcising folly and needless obsession.\n\"Come see me, you idiotic problem gambler.\"\n\"And don't lose your way this time, Konbumaru.\"\nStill, who won the last throw of the dice...\nShe touched the bow lightly while pondering such unimportant things."

All you have seen of me is but a residual vision, born of your wishes.\"\nIn that vague memory, she kept saying some incomprehensible things.

How about this, then? I, the Lady Saiguu, shall tell your fortune for you!\"\n\"Haha, see? See, it's \"Great Fortune.\" \"Great Fortune\"! You know what that means?\"\n\"It means that you took away all the bad fortune slips.
