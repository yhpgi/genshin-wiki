Only the epithet \"Balemoon\" remained to stain the lingering detritus.\nWhether the unclean who suffered from the curse, or those unblemished ones not yet tainted by fate, none would again consider themselves a follower of the moon's remnants.\nFew survived the utter destruction of their kind, hiding in the shadows where the sun did not shine, longing for the Crimson Moon to decree their desire for vengeance be repaid—\nBut the so-called repayment never came, and the dark sun fell to the same ignorance and arrogance.\nWhen destruction once again was nigh, only the mocking moonlight spilled forth upon the shadow of the sun, long burnt to ash.\n\"Fate, fate, O terrifying and pale fate, why must you abase yourself and submit to such a tyrannical usurper\nIf the Balemoon's remnants had already sealed your doom, what meaning could be found in the blood vengeance of bygone days?\nIf the destiny she wove mocks us so, then let us mock destiny as loudly as we may\nUntil the last shadow of the ashen sun burns away the old world, until the Crimson Moon witnesses the immaculate dawn.\""
