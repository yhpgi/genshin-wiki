            "text": "It was the age when the banners of the tribes had been coated in dust, gradually losing their color.\nAnd before the throne stands a half-man holding a cracked ring, playing with preeminence.\nStrict orders were given that none should ever again give ear to the instructions left by the deep messengers of twilight, the distant ancestors, and the first ascended—\nTo hear them not from the mud-caked roots of trees, the flickering flames of bonfires, or the reflections found in the deep woods.\nAnd so, the ancient gloom, the moment that engulfs a million darknesses, came at last,\nJust as the stench of iron lingers even as bloodstains upon the ancient scrolls fade.\nAnd so, when the pitch-black darkness thick enough to touch seized the depths,\nThe red-eyed youth, through countless calamities, returned from the kingdom where water flowed as rays of light to the hilly heights of the ineffable city.\nAs he stepped into the floating garden, the raspy warning of the blind, stooped old woman still clutched at his ear:\n\"As radiant flowers still blossom amongst the clinging vines of distant marsh,\nGo seek, for here is the land of death, piled high with the skulls of behemoths—\nGo seek those the truly righteous, who are still willing to stand in the cold, cruel night, to throw themselves onto the fire,\nAnd remember — never betray their passion, their hatred, their greed, and their ambition!\nDo not break faith with the eyes of those still willing to gaze upon the burning flames.\"\nThe first to arrive was a young girl, holding a dulled feather accessory. She sought out information for the youth like a quetzal, flitting between the tall tents.\nThe second were the hero twins, the elder whose lips and teeth were sharper than any blade, and the younger whose back bore the brunt of the tyrant's lash.\nUpon hearing of how the scarlet-eyed youth had saved the Saurians, the taciturn warrior too was willing to contribute his strength.\n\"But we need someone who understands the layout of this city better than anyone,\nWho can point out the paths in passages open and secret, and manipulate mechanisms as one might do to toys in the palm of their hand.\"\nAfter the scarlet-eyed youth had spoken thus, the usually reticent and reserved hero,\nThat powerful hero who hoped Saurians and humans would live together in peace, remembered the rumor and spoke the name of a craftsman."

The craftsman saw the same hatred he nursed burning within her eyes.\n\"Then I shall gladly serve you...r lord,\" he said, before she had even spoken of her purpose.\nIn his heart, he was actually willing to serve her, but that was not something he needed to say.\nFor he could see that at this time, someone else already occupied the girl's heart."

It is said that was a time when a black shadow shrouded the sun.\nThe heroes who had long prepared for this moment seized the opportunity to overthrow the insane king before the empty throne.\nIn the non-mainstream, unofficial histories, the man behind the plan was a skilled artisan who left no name behind.\n\"But the artisan left behind not a single word in the war that returned authority to the tribes\nAnd afterward, he disappeared without a trace from the old stories, covered by layer upon narrative layer.\"\nThe youth smoothed over the nearly identical scratches on the sundials with his hand.\nImagining a time, unnumbered sunsets before, after the date to execute the plan had been agreed upon, those hands that might not ever have existed,\nAnd the moment the owner of those hands had engraved those marks upon the sundials."

The man had long grown accustomed to it.\nAs he felt the young girl's inquisitive gaze reach him, he forced a derisive laugh, causing the muscles in half his face to sting slightly.\nIn truth, he had seen far more in those flames that had nearly rendered his life as ash, such as flowing golden patterns,\nAnother path to escape from the ruins, as well as the manifold iron rules that had established the empire that stretched far and wide.\nBut the latter might be too far beyond the ken of the youths...\nHe set aside his wine vessel, which had but a few drops sloshing about the bottom left.\nPerhaps, when the dust finally settled, and when the ancient cornerstone was restored,\nWhen all had progressed farther, he could reveal everything, and this pleased him,\nFor at this time, his wildest fantasies already revolved around how to craft a brilliant imperial wall for the new king."

And so,\nShe used the time left to her to gather all that was left behind by the heroes she missed.\nThe scarlet-eyed youth she had loved had returned to the sacred flames after completing his calling, leaving nothing but a warm afterglow.\nAnd when the silent hero fell into the ruler's flames, the new world reflected in his remaining eye was already his greatest reward.\nOne of the hero twins was once an incorrigible chatterbox, yet upon witnessing his brother die at the hands of their adversary, his tormented wails wracked his throat hoarse.\n\"And yet Atawallpa, too, died before me... Who could have imagined that I, the frailest of us, would have lived to the end?\nThe wise amongst the tribes often say that those who have been tossed about by the winds and waves will grow tired of the steady ground, and I am no exception.\nThese years without all of you here... have truly been too dull.\"\nBut there will surely come a time for a reunion with friends long-since passed, and when long-awaited premonition comes to pass.\nShe picked the genuine articles that the craftsman had made from among her jewels — compared with the forgeries, they were all too few,\nAnd with those things bearing his name, she walked into the dark night, never to return.\nAccording to legend, on the next day, the people stood under the tree where she had placed the turquoise crown,\nAnd they swore an oath to follow her final orders, blotting from history the name of the masterful craftsman she took away with her."
