The city that would be called Ochkanatlan in the future was a city of dragons â€” the\nDragonlord CL-09 \"Chronicler of the End Times\" Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon (Type-L Self-Regulating Overseer Array Integrated Processing Unit), one of the thirteen Dragonlords, was the sovereign ruler of Chichen Uctokah. The thirteen sovereign rulers were not ordinary dragons but forms of artificial intelligence created by the Pyro Dragon using secret source technology. This bodiless wisdom, stored in majestic statues, could control all the mechanisms of the city with the help of golden designs and commands. The main core of Chichen Uctokah was the Core of Chu'ulel. When the Python King, Och-Kan, came to power millennia later, he announced the excavation of the ancient ruins in search of the core and met the Dragonlord there. Although she believed him to be the fated Sovereign, he tricked her into imprisoning her in a statue to control the mechanisms of Ochkanatlan, tore her heart apart, and hid it in various places. It was only many years later, when the ruins were discovered by the Traveler and Paimon, that Ixlel's heart, as Paimon called her, was reassembled. The\ncreated before the fires of human civilization had ever been kindled contained all of Ixlel's memories, and it was these memories that bound her within the statue. Her consciousness should have faded within thirty years, but the Dragonlord did not want to die in captivity. Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L could not destroy herself, but thanks to the heart fragments the Traveler found, she was able to restore the remains of her\nand restore her broken heart as a sign of self-protection so as not to violate the sacred law. When the consciousness contained within the statue was finally released and dissipated, all that remained of the ruler of Chichen Uctokah was the Perfect Heart of the Sacred Dragon, which no human gem could compare to."

When the Abyss was defeated, Mavuika was ready to repay the debt, asking in return for the restoration of Natlan's Ley Lines from the Lord of the Night, who created the Night Kingdom. Her power would be enough to maintain the Ley Lines for two hundred years, during which time the next Pyro Archon would have to find a new way. She went to the throne of the first Pyro Archon to meet the Ruler of Death and the Lord of the Night and die, but another man approached the Lord of the Night with the same offer, the First of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and the Sentinel Knight of Khaenri'ah,"

Although most people were innocent and unaware of the Sinners, they were cursed to suffer endless physical torment, cursed to witness the demise of everything they held dear. For five hundred years, Il Capitano had kept the souls of his fallen comrades and the Natlanese in his heart, ready to send them home. The Ley Lines could not accept these souls, but by becoming one with the Lord of the Night, the Sentinel Knight could change the laws that governed the Ley Lines so that the souls could find peace. The Captain gave the Ruler of Death a choice: if he sacrificed his life to the Lord of the Night, Ronova would get the death she desired, but the curse of immortality would negate the very death. Knowing that the curse of immortality could not be lifted and that such a paradox could uproot the natural order of this world, Il Capitano decided to turn the curse into a tool to overturn the oppression of the gods. The Lord of the Night, whose mission was to serve humanity, agreed to the Sentinel Knight's plan and accepted his sacrifice, merging with him. The curse of immortality was not lifted, and Il Capitano remained to sit for eternity on the Throne of the Primal Fire, \"frozen\" in life and death. For those cursed with immortality, release from the mortal coil was the greatest form of peace, and his path was finally over. Through Il Capitano's sacrifice, the Lord of Night and the Ley Lines of Natlan can exist forever, accepting all souls."

The second flint lights up the juncture of setting forth, the day the journey begins, called farewell. In its departure, the unchanging world betrays people, and yet some try to grasp its shadow. The third flint lights up a daytime of celebration, the moment of open hearts, called friendship. This journey is far from a solitary trial; not only the winds but human hearts too, embrace along the way. The fourth flint lights up a tempestuous night of rain-soaked despair and a sea of anguishing descent called failure. Fighting against the rising tide, a little boat is very nearly submerged; yet, thankfully, it cannot prize the oars from the hands. The fifth flint lights up those days of pushing onward, and the stones with which tall towers are built are called determination. The higher the people climb, the higher and higher they go until at last, they glimpse the destination they have long dreamed of. The sixth flint lights up the moment of arrival and the seats upon which the people may evermore rest, which is called a miracle. Together, one can bring this journey to its conclusion, but instead of an ending, one can see this as a new beginning."

It was rumored that those who encountered these pests would fall into the throes of an illness that would grip them day and night, of how the boils that broke forth all over their bodies would be followed by incessant vomiting, before they finally suffered a drastic change in personality and eventually became so frail that they perished. The warriors who could not be saved had wounds on their bodies as if they had been torn to pieces by something sharp. One of the guards who arrived on the island believed that the Saurians should be exterminated and not waste food on them since the only thing they deserved to eat was a good old knuckle sandwich. Over time, the guard came to love the Saurians and realized that they were not \"pests\" and did not cause festering wounds. Even when the rations were cut, he was not ready to cut back on bird eggs for the hatchlings, who needed extra nutrition to grow. Sometime later, an order came to the Isle of Night to exterminate all Saurians, but the commander of the guards released them all after receiving the notification."

In those days, they set up a stairway to reach beyond the skies and were preparing to leave it beyond the orbit and use it to tighten the sky cable and anchor the latter's trajectory. Later, Och-Kan modified it to become Tonatiuh. Once, the Tonatiuh hovering above the clouds was the cherished goal of many adventurers. In the past, many empty dreams failed here, but the path of hope also began here. On the ship, Och-Kan left notes for his compatriots to guide them along the path of the Pyro Archon. The Python King believed that humans could not rely on dragons or heavenly rules. The ancient dragons believed that technology and the power of the Lord of Fire would allow them to rule for ten thousand years, but in the end, they lost their desire for progress and lost everything. Och-Kan wrote that the Vishaps of the Great Volcano once held themselves masters of evolution, but they lost their wisdom in their lengthy, chaotic adaptations, and with it, their power, becoming but beasts to be slaughtered by humans. Their devolution proved that dragon-kind had been abandoned by the evolutionary path, their heirs had lost the primal flame's purity, and the sovereign of fire shall never again be born from amongst them. After the fall of the Vishaps, humanity became the apex life form, the final destination of all things that live in this world. That is why people had to pray only to the true king of humanity, the only real human god, Xbalanque."

Och-Kan, who proclaimed himself the Sacred Lord, decided that the god he had loved and shed golden tears for should forever remain the one and only. He became the ruler of the first city of the Pyro Archon, which was named Ochkanatlan, and led the Grand Alliance, founded by Xbalanque, to unite all the tribes under its rule. Among Och-Kan's allies were Yupanqui, a warrior from the Scions of the Canopy, and Uenuku from the People of the Springs, followed by the Oceanids. In order to create an ideal world for people, the Sacred Lord decided to become the sole ruler of Natlan. The experience of the desert realms and the barbarians of the northern sea showed that multiplicity leads only to endless internal strife. The various tribes were not allowed to overstep their bounds and claim kingship as they did before. In Ochkanatlan, sacrifices and worship of the Lord of the Night were prohibited. Och-Kan believed that humanity could move forward along the chosen path. For this, it was necessary to forbid all offerings to the Night Kingdom, so the souls of traitors would not entice the living, and the people wouldn't become the\npuppets. He hoped to create this world for the people for the sake of Xbalanque. People should rely on neither the wisdom of dragons nor heaven, as heaven didn't care about the will of those who dwelled in this world. People were viewed as pillars that bear up the earth, necessary for the struggle against their personal foes. And so, people should pray to the one and only Pyro Archon, Xbalanque, and follow his path, not submitting to the Flame or the Night. Under his guidance, humanity came to rule the land, and the Sacred Lord believed that one day, they would conquer the heavens too."

Numerous legends of incredible adventures would later become the origins of the traditions of both the Collective of Plenty and the mines. After the first Pyro Archon entered the Sacred Flame and Och-Kan came to power, the brother and sister quarreled, and Ixquieh left the Grand Alliance. Although her brother never expressed disagreement with the hero's teachings about the peaceful coexistence of humans and Saurians, everyone knew about his hostility to dragons. So when the ruler of the forbidden city tentatively ordered that the fleeing wicked dragons be pursued, among the heroes who still served the Alliance then, only Ahpub, Och-Kan's best friend, answered the call. As Chief, he led countless warriors of the Collective of Plenty before the mines in the mountains, asking Ixquieh, the ruler of the Nanatzcayan, to hand over the \"ferocious beasts hidden in the mountains\" or face their blades. After facing off for several days, the hero invited his twin sister to the place of reunion to speak, intending to remind her of the oath."

Holding his sister in his arms, the hero entered the incinerating fire. Another legend claims that the siblings survived â€” and, having uncovered the tyrant's plot to stir up discord, fled together to a distant land, and so the Collective of Plenty inclined towards fighting with their bare hands. With the disappearance of the two Chiefs, the beacons of war never flared up, and Och-Kan, pretending to spare the dragons, sent emissaries to attempt to persuade those of the canyons and Plenty to temporarily hand authority over to the Alliance until both tribes could choose new Chiefs. At the same time, he secretly recorded the names of those who had sheltered the dragons, waiting for a chance to take the traitors' heads."

A mighty army razed the fortress of mists to the ground, and the hero Maghan, who had once fought alongside the One Entombed With the Primal Fire and had not lost his former valor, led the attack. Before the dragons could awaken from their dream, he had slain the traitors who had made a pact with them, thus ending the conflict.

The Cuauhtli Scouts learned that the \"hollows\" under the city were flooded, but there should have been the Core of Chu'ulel in the depths. The Sacred Lord asked to send one person from ten families of each tribe to build irrigation structures so that it would be possible to pump water out of the \"hollows.\" All the tribes sent one person from every ten households, who enthusiastically started working. While exploring the ruins, Uenuku committed folly and was to be burned by dragon fire, but he was shielded by an Oceanid, whose dream was to cleanse the springs of phlogiston and fill them with clear water. After this, Uenuku left the Grand Alliance, and the Oceanids disappeared, which complicated the process of pumping out the water. The deeper the workers dug, the stronger the indescribable, nauseating stench became, and superstitions began to spread among the workers. One craftsman suddenly lost his wits and began babbling that he saw an almost impossibly hideous silhouette under the water, commanding him to kneel down before the \"Master.\" Although the supervisors took away the craftsman, a sense of unease had already begun to spread among the workers. From behind the ancient walls, faint, furtive, and muffled sounds, as if something was scurrying through the walls, were heard. The laborers whispered, trembling with an incoherent terror, sure that some unimaginable, profane curse lurked beneath the water's depths. And that they had awakened \"it\" from countless eons of slumber. The supervisors explained everything by auditory hallucinations due to a lack of rest and applied for extra grain rations for them. Yet, the fear that had spread among the laborers was already unstoppable."

There, the Sacred Lord met the Dragonlord, Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L, the ruler of Chichen Uctokah. She called him the fated Sovereign and spoke of the glory of the dragons. The Dragonlord told all about the ancient empire of the dragons: the ladders that climbed up to the firmament, the great weapons and cannons, the research and wishes. Learning about his ancestors' past, the Python King realized that under no circumstances should dragons be allowed to return to their former glory, or humanity would be powerless to stand against them. There was no way to negotiate with the dragons and their descendants, and all the beasts had to be detained. Och-Kan wanted to use Dragonlord's knowledge and her energy, which was used to control the Source Mechanisms, so he tricked her into trapping her memories in a statue from an ancient era.\nEven when the Dragonlord was imprisoned in a statue, she refused to obey the Sacred Lord and control the ancient mechanisms, which only dragons were capable of. To protect humanity from the threat, Och-Kan decided to create a Core of Chu'ulel that owes allegiance to humanity alone. Over time, he realized that if only the beasts' blood could control the mechanisms, he had no choice but to enslave the \"draconic\" part of himself to control the Core. And even should his \"human\" parts perish, his \"draconic\" components would remain imprisoned in a slave body and would forever submit to humans and their will and ideals. The Sacred Lord couldn't trust any power mightier than humanity since everyone who possessed power committed appalling evils. Even he himself was no exception."

The commoners believed that the taboo on worshiping the Lord of the Night and the sacrifices had aroused their rage and curses, which is why this dark, mortal illness descended upon them. By the Holy Sovereign's decree, the three areas in the southwest sector of Ochkanatlan had been sealed off, and the Cuauhtli Warriors unsuccessfully burned the infected, whose flesh had long since decomposed. The Python King ordered the city to be permanently sealed so that the Abyss would not break through the walls. No matter how things would become outside, the kindling of human \"hope\" would forever remain inside. Flesh and blood might slough away, bone and marrow might rot, and even the soul might plummet into a prison from which there is no return, but \"hope\" alone must never be forsaken, for this was the sole treasure left by Xbalanque.

Upon hearing of how the scarlet-eyed youth had saved the Saurians, the ordnance officer of the Grand Alliance, Yupanqui, who did not dare to rebel against his old friend, decided to contribute his strength. To get into the Forbidden City, they needed a man who knew all the roads, paths, and secret passages of the city and could operate any mechanisms. And then the silent Yupanqui named the master."

Among the workers who were locked near the dragon statue site was Manqu, and when he was lying under the grotesque dragon statue, doomed to die, surrounded by all-consuming flames in Och-Kan's fire, he suddenly saw a young woman whose face was more beautiful than the purest crystal, and whose eyes were more beautiful than the purest turquoise. Despite her beauty, her face was so nauseatingly repulsive. Her smile was laced with a cruel and arrogant malice. The craftsman opened his mouth to beg her to save him, but his lips burned beyond all recognition, and he could not utter a single word. The woman held his face in her hand, and from those turquoise eyes, golden tears fell into Manqu's eyes. And then he saw a colossal creation, far larger than the rolling mountains, floating in the sky like a volcanic cloud; countless metal birds greedily sucking dark blood and shadows driven by flowing flames, climbing high from distant horizons to the moon up in the sky. She sneered by his ear that people could crawl around beneath the heavens, trembling away while seeking their inglorious graves, and the ancient dragons fought an inveterate foe as formidable as an entire world. Through the turquoise eyes of the woman, the craftsman saw naught but endless, unfathomable darkness and void that no language could describe. Then, Manqu screamed at the top of his lungs and, stumbling, crawled towards the secret path, but his scream was drowned in the laughter of the woman. When the craftsman woke up, he was completely alone. He didn't know if the woman existed or if it was delirium, if there were tears, or if they were drops that fell from the giant dragon statue behind her, but he was alive.\nWhile Manqu was passing the time in dirty taverns, he met Sakkuk, who was looking for the craftsman who had created a masterful turquoise feather for her father. The scars of having been burnt by a raging blaze marred the half of his face that was hidden under a hat, the flesh a melted slurry of blood, but Sakkuk was not afraid and handed him the plume. When he learned that the man to whom he gave the feather was the girl's father, the craftsman agreed to serve her and her master. When their rebellion was crowned with success, people said that the man behind the plan was a skilled artisan who left no name behind. Manqu planned to disconnect the city from the power source and turn off the Core of Chu'ulel so that Yupanqui, taking advantage of the confusion, would deliver the youth with scarlet eyes to the throne room of the Sacred Lord."

To emulate Xbalanque, the first human to ascend, he sacrificed his heart with a golden dagger and then returned from the kingdom where water flows as rays of light, becoming the second Pyro Archon of Natlan. So that people would know that every human can become the god that guides them, the scarlet-eyed youth asked Sakkuk, who was in love with him, to erase his name from history. When the youth had fulfilled his mission, he returned to the Sacred Flame, leaving behind nothing but a warm glow. The artisan, Manqu, could not escape the burning city because the Flower-Feather Clan had walled up the secret exits, and the hero twin, Atawallpa, died at the hands of the enemy. The silent warrior Yupanqui died from the Turnfire. To this day, the Scions of the Canopy have a legend about a hero with the Ancient name Malipo. According to the legend, Och-Kan used the Turnfire to rule Natlan and oppress anyone who opposed him. Turnfire is different from normal fire: if one gets set on fire with it, they will feel a horrible burning pain from behind them, but they won't die from it right away. And whatever you do, you mustn't turn back to look at it. Yupanqui stole the Turnfire and threw it at the Och-Kan's army. All the soldiers were burned to ashes. Just as Yupanqui was about to leave the city, he thought he heard Och-kan calling out to him from behind. It caught him off guard, and he turned around to look, but Och-kan was not there. All he saw was a city burned black, an army in ruins, and giant flames reaching up into the sky. A split second later, the flames he saw burst out from inside his eyes and swallowed Yupanqui up. This fire burned more fiercely than any other. It burned for a hundred days, until it burned a hole right through the ley lines, and then fell into the deathly dark Night Kingdom, where it still burns to this day. The Turnfire lights up the path that leads to the next life. But for the dead to be reborn, they have to accept the flames and be purified by the fire first.\nAfter Sakkuk returned to her tribe, she asked to make the long-dulled feather for her again. She promised the craftsman that when the time came, she would give them a turquoise crown in return. It was after witnessing the crooked corpse agonizingly hunched beneath the black beast's butcher's blade that she understood that the crown would wait alone for its master. For many years, she collected jewelry and even forgery that was signed by Manqu, gifting those who presented them with precious gems. The mistress of the mines did not want the crude forgeries to stain the good name of an artisan who created the originals, and deceivers with forgeries were always punished. At the end of her life, Sakkuk collected all the works bearing Manqu's name and walked into the dark night, never to return. According to legend, on the next day, the people stood under the tree where she had placed the turquoise crown, and they swore an oath to follow her final orders, blotting from history the name of the masterful craftsman she took away with her."

In hot springs, now fresh blood and mud ran over the banks.

It was akin to a golden wheel that could reverse time's flow, burning away the writhing agonizing present and bringing the beautiful past back. And this treasure could only be obtained in the depths of Ochkanatlan, flooded with filth. People who had given up on fighting the Abyss decided to try their luck and go in search of the Jade, even if it was a trap. When Natlan was overrun by corruption, an evil dragon appeared in Cinder City. All the adventurers who went in hopes of destroying the Abyss were defeated by the dragon, and almost none of them returned.\nAmong these adventurers was a group that set out for the city in the clouds ten years after the Cataclysm. The group's leader was the most powerful warrior of the Flower-Feather Clan, Taika. Before the Cataclysm, he had always won in combat duels and was bored, thinking that his whole life would pass like this. It was only after witnessing true war that he first felt the weight of destiny. Thus did he bid his wife and unborn child farewell and set out to drive the evil spirits away. In the city, he discovered the blueprints of Ochkanatlan, thanks to which the group was able to find the Altar of Primal Fire and reach the flying ship. But the battle on the Tonatiuh was his last, and before his death, he remembered the words he said to his he said to his beloved wife as they parted."

The fifth member of the team was the warrior Quenin of the Flower-Feather Clan. Every night when he tried to sleep, he heard the voices of inhuman monsters in the Cinder City, which were capable of disguising themselves in different forms. They hid in the ancient ruins, so he could not sleep. When the pitch-black tide almost reached the team, Quenin stayed to evacuate the survivors so that the rescue team from the Flower-Feather Clan could take them to a safe place. Sometimes, he woke up and saw that a road that was perfectly intact just the day before had now become broken and dilapidated, and sometimes, he saw friends who were long gone. Quenin fell in battle with these monsters, and his form was taken by one of them. Not realizing that he had become a monster himself, Quenin continued to protect adventurers. Only when the Traveler revealed the secret of the fallen warrior, he realized that he had long since become a monster. Members of the Children of Echoes also joined the team.\nThe last to join the party was the young shaman Liriwu from the Masters of the Night-Wind. When she joined the party, the apprentice of the apprentice of the apprentice of Grand Master Sanhaj was full of faith in her powers, but she could not imagine that the Cinder City would be swarming with hordes of demons. In Ochkanatlan, the voice of the Wayob was not heard, the secret techniques of the Masters of the Night-Wind did not work, and the mystic could not even heal wounds. One night, she tried to sneak away. Her party members realized that Liriwu would not be able to go further and left her in a safe tower. When the shaman finally reached their camp, all that awaited were the shattered remains of the dragon's hearty meal. As a mystic, not only had she failed to rescue her allies, but she could not bring their souls back, either. If nothing else, she had to bring tales of their end back to their families who yet awaited their return. Upon her return, Liriwu left the last remaining fragment of Pyrophosphorite in the world, which was needed to find the Jade of Return, with Taika's newborn daughter."

What we had been doing, they said, had awakened \"it\" from countless eons of slumber. No one would leave this ruin alive, and even if they did, they could never tell anyone about it â€” for listeners would just dismiss such claims as the ramblings of lunatics.\nI could not find a rational explanation for this loathsome, frightful terror; for by all accounts, those damp, fungus-covered walls that supported the vaulted ceiling should have been built from solid rock, and the echoes they produced when tapped confirmed this. Yet those terrifying rustling sounds continued to reverberate through the dead of night, jarring me into the confusion of half-wakefulness from what was uneasy sleep to begin with.\nOur supervisor reassured us that she herself had not heard anything unusual, attributing our hallucinations to lack of rest. She even applied for extra grain rations for us, out of sympathy for our plight. Yet the fear that had spread among the laborers was so intense that...\n(The long segment that follows has been deliberately erased, and it cannot be read.)"

I would hazard that I will be able to walk normally again after sleeping twice more, at most.\nI do not know whether I should record all that I have seen, for neither words nor logic can explain the things I have experienced. Yet, unless there is a way to erase these memories, I do not have it in me to suppress the urge to write it all down. As I record it here, I pray to (...) that no one will ever read this.\nBack when it happened, beneath that giant, grotesque statue, I met a young woman within Och-Kan's fire.\nSlowly and calmly she walked towards me, as if the fire were nothing more than a gentle spring breeze. Her face... I have never seen anything like it. Even the purest of crystals could not be fashioned into the likeness of such skin, nor could the purest of turquoise be carved into such eyes. Yet for reasons I cannot explain, that face, which should have been the very picture of beauty, was... so nauseatingly repulsive.\nI did not know who â€” nor even what â€” she was. I opened my mouth and wanted to beg her, beg her to save me, yet my lips... had been burned beyond all recognition, and I could not utter even a single word.\nShe smiled, a smile laced with a cruel and arrogant malice. She held my face in her hand, and from those turquoise eyes, golden tears fell into mine.\nAnd then I saw it.\nA colossal creation, far larger than the rolling mountains, shining with a brilliance more dazzling than obsidian, floating in the sky like a volcanic cloud. Around it circled countless giant metal birds, greedily sucking away at its dark blood. I saw shadows driven by flowing flames, climbing high from distant horizons to the moon up in the sky, from which tremors and sighs were sent out unimaginable distances via but a single string woven from gold and white copper. She sneered by my ear, as if all humanity had achieved up to this point was nothing more than child's play, as utterly inconsequential as the doings of ants, of beings capable only of crawling around beneath the heavens, trembling away while seeking their inglorious graves. And what they fought, what they were pitted up against, was an inveterate foe as formidable as an entire world. Through those turquoise eyes, those pupils whose beauty was almost terrifying, I saw naught but endless, unfathomable darkness and void; a space that no language could describe, unlike anything I have ever seen in the brief few decades of my transient life. So it was that I began to scream, stumbling as I crawled along that path, but even my blood-curdling screams were drowned out by her laughter, and dissipated without a trace.\nWhen I next woke, I was lying here alone. I did not dare look back, lest those profane, forbidden things, those things that no person should ever know, might catch and tear me to pieces. The others must all have died, perishing in the flames of Och-Kan's fire.\nPerhaps those were not her tears. Perhaps they were simply drops of water that fell from that giant, grotesque stone statue behind her. Perhaps there was nothing in the fire, and that woman was just an illusion of my delirium, something I imagined as I stood on the precipice of death. But now, none of that matters; for I am still alive, and that is all that counts.\nOch-Kan thinks that the secret passages of the ineffable city are now unbeknownst to all but him, and that his reign will last for a thousand years. He is mistaken; for at most, it will last a thousand weeks."

Weather's good, but I can't say that about my mood.\nI knew I was here to watch over these troublesome pests, yet I had not expected there to be quite so many of them.\nI have heard messengers from Cinder City tell of how those who encountered these pests would fall into the throes of an illness that would grip them day and night, of how the boils that broke forth all over their bodies would be followed by incessant vomiting, before they finally suffered a drastic change in personality and eventually became so frail that they perished.\nAnd we have all heard of the terrible transformation that befell Lord Milchi after coming into contact with them, ranting day and night about tearing any who would dare set foot upon the Isle of Night limb from limb. If even a hero of such stature met with such a fate, then surely any ordinary person wouldn't stand a chance?\nAnd there were also those warriors that Dad could not save... the wounds that were left on their bodies, as if they had been torn to shreds by something sharp. These pests bristle with spikes and fangs, so this must have been their doing too...\nThey should have been eradicated long ago! I cannot for the life of me understand why we're wasting time watching over them, even feeding them... In the words of Lord Och-Kan, the only thing they deserve to eat is a good old knuckle sandwich!\nAlas, if I had known, I would have just followed in Dad's footsteps and studied medicine, or else trained properly with Mom. Now, here I am... No longer with any hope of becoming either a warrior or a doctor, just a lousy guard for these wretched pests. Sure sucks to be me...\n...\nDay 475, and the weather is clear.\nThankfully, finally, Lord Milchi came back today. Another two days and we'd have run out of food for real.\nNo more Grainfruit, Cacahuatl, or meat of any kind... And no more Mora, either.\nHmph! Saurus Crackers and Grainfruit for breakfast, meat for lunch, and fish for dinner â€” no wonder all the Mora's gone! All the money I'd saved up to buy a ladder spent on stuffing their bellies!\nNow even the skinniest Saurians are at least a couple of belly sizes up from what mine would be if I were one of them, yet still they make me climb up and down all day... \"a bit of exercise,\" they call it. If you ask me, these Saurians should have to maintain the switches themselves! Let them get some exercise and lose some weight so they don't end up getting sick, and I don't end up having to make more medicine for them.\nBut still, itâ€™s true that we can't cut back on bird eggs for the hatchlings. They only just hatched, and they're still growing, so they need the extra nutrition.\nAlso, it seems a few more invaders arrived today, trying to set fire to the entire Isle of Night. Thankfully, the Secret Source Sentinels spotted them and chased them off before it was too late. Otherwise, things could've gotten really bad...\nThose fools from Cinder City, we chase away one batch of them, and another shows up. All they ever talk about is \"curses\" and \"pests.\" They can't be reasoned with, and they're bent on wrecking things too. Such a pain in the...\nâ€”Ha! Illnesses? Festering wounds? Where did they get such nonsense from? These Saurians might be a bit on the energetic side, and they sure have big appetites, but they're clean as clean can be. I should know, because I'm the one who washes them! They're spotless â€” cleaner than any of you lot, that's for sure!\nAnd curses? If it wasn't for Lord Milchi's kind heart, I would've had the Secret Source Sentinels clobber you fools long ago! And the idea of Atlatl being cursed... What a joke.\nIf Lord Milchi would just listen to me and assent to the use of stronger weapons, we'd have long since washed our hands of all this. It's driving me up the wall... Anyway, that's enough for today. I still have to repair the switches and get on with my training tomorrow, so there'll be plenty for me to get on with...\n...\nI've lost count of how many days it's been, and I have no idea what the weather is like outside. If I had to guess, I'd say this is about the fifth day I've been in hiding. This will probably end up being the last diary entry I make.\nIf I'd have known things would come to this, I should have tried harder to stop Lord Milchi. Thinking back on it all, there were so many warning signs...\nMore and more frequent attacks, restless packs of Saurians, unhatched Saurian eggs, orders to execute the little ones, and rumors of rebellions among the various tribes...\nIn such a dire situation, a summons could only ever mean bad news.\nAside from blades, I honestly cannot imagine what else might await Lord Milchi...\nAnd the end result was never in doubt either. The Isle of Night was utterly defenseless without Lord Milchi, and would have fallen to any old band of warriors.\nFortunately, Lord Milchi was ready, and as soon as the orders came through, was able to take advantage of the chaos to set the little ones free.\nBut Saurian eggs don't have legs, nor can they be so easily transported, so I had to hide it. If only Lord Atlatl were still here... With his help, I'm sure we could have moved it too.\nI honestly cannot fathom why Lord Milchi chose not to escape with us, and instead insisted on confronting Och-Kan...\nOh right! Also, while hiding the egg, I gave it the name that I had long since planned to give it: Aguara. This name even sounds cunning, so perhaps it will help protect it.\nJust as I thought, all those feeble, non-lethal security measures were completely useless again warriors set on bloodshed â€” I've been saying that all along... Thankfully, they did not find the underground chamber, so I can hide out here for another couple of days.\nBut how long can I carry on hiding here? They've stayed put this whole time, and show no sign of retreating. I don't know what they're looking for, but whatever it is, they haven't found it yet.\nMy food's all gone, and I feel as if I am gradually slipping into unconsciousness. Whether I give myself up or stay here, I'm guessing it'll end the same way...\nBut I cannot let go of Aguara. Though I've put the egg into hibernation, I am not sure how long it will last. Ah, Aguara, you impatient little critter. Why the big hurry? Just wait a bit longer... Your time has not come. The Natlan of today is not ready to be your home, not yet...\nSpeaking of home, I do not believe I have returned to visit, nor have I sent a single letter back, not once since I arrived in this place.\nIf only I had listened to Mom and Dad, put my mind into my medical studies and training... Might things have turned out differently? Might I have been able to protect everyone?\nAguara, I wish I could see what you'll look like... But I guess I never will."
