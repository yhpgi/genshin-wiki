And only then will the arrogance of those who conspire to rebel be put to rest once and for all.\nBased on an inscription, we decided to abandon our original plans of exploring <color=#ffe14b>the cellar in the southwestern ruins</color> in favor of going to a locked secret chamber.\nAccording to the inscription text deciphered by Master Eberhart, the chamber should contain impressive ancient frescoes along with weapons forged from Starsilver.\nIf that's the case, this could easily be the most significant archaeological discovery in decades.\nThat's what Master Ingbert said, at least. But somehow my heart still can't forget the companions we lost in the snowstorm just days before.\nI sincerely hope that Master Eberhart was right when he said that they were aristocratic children rigorously trained from childhood, and perfectly capable of making their way back to camp on their own.\nWe shall soon set off from <color=#ffe14b>South Base Camp</color> to delve further into the inner reaches of the ruins.\nThis time, it is imperative that we closely examine the stability of the ruins before we enter."
