Plaustrite is crucial for Mingxiao Lanterns and when donated, the donor will write their heart's desires onto it, as a prayer for good fortune and other blessings. There are unique varieties like Azurite, found in the northern Mt. Tianheng, and Vermillionite, utilized by grounded Ruin Hunters in Guili Plains for flight.

Despite fireworks being commonly used in Teyvat, they have a long history and a deeper meaning connected to Liyue. According to Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, fireworks were originally developed alongside many other inventions in Liyue. When Liyue's ancestors first created fireworks, they were originally known as \"Firecrackers.\" Their bright flashes and loud sounds were often used for warding off beasts or as warning signals to other people. In those days, it was difficult for people to contact one another while farming the land, so they would carry firecrackers with them to give signals when necessary. However, people's lifestyles began to change after Liyue Harbor was founded. They no longer had to travel out of town to tend the fields anymore, so the use of firecrackers for emergencies also began to dwindle. But through Liyue's local customs, the pioneering spirit of the firecrackers has been passed down to this very day. A lot of the fireworks used during the Lantern Rite were purchased from the Naganohara Fireworks shop. Yoimiya made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue. Exports like these weren't allowed under the Sakoku Decree, but there can't be festivals without fireworks."

Although kites are one of Liyue's most time-honored cultural relics, outside of their use in certain ceremonies, they're considered \"playthings\" more than anything. A flimsy paper kite attached to a string has the capacity to touch the sky and also carries the weight of Liyue's cultural traditions. For example, whenever a kite blew away, people would say it was the Adepti that summoned the wind to take it away as an offering. That way, people can turn an unfortunate event into an auspicious one. Some people write down certain names or desires on their kites, cut the string, and let them fly free. Others may place particular thoughts or meaning into the design itself. Each design has its own meaning. Kites in the shape of a butterfly typically symbolize freedom, happiness, or the desire to break free. The scissor-tailed swallow is the most classic design, which symbolizes good fortune and joyful tidings. The Jade Chamber, the newest and the most popular design symbolizes wealth and abundance. The kite bearing its design is said to bring riches to those who fly it in the future."

Every year during the Lantern Rite, people in Liyue make gift envelopes and give them to their friends and family, sending them their best wishes. In the past, people would buy ready-made envelopes and exchange them with their family and friends, but the Ministry of Civil Affairs has set up a stand for foreign tourists to make their own envelopes, and even those who are the least fond of books were getting in on the action. Each envelope can be stamped with Guyan Sigils, the symbol of Rex Lapis, which is believed to be used as a protective talisman. Every Lantern Rite, the Feiyun Commerce Guild sends gift envelopes to their business partners. The guild head, Xingqiu's great-grandpa, always writes them by hand as a sign of respect. His calligraphy is a sight to behold — so sharp and elegant. In the eyes of his partners, his envelopes are more valuable than any gift, they even frame them and put them on display."

There are twelve designs in total, each engraved with motifs from the Guyan Sigils that represent different blessings. These coins are usually placed in gift envelopes, and if rubbed, they will bring good luck. One special coin is the \"Rex Coin\" with the symbol of Rex Lapis. It is believed that such a coin has passed through the hands of the Geo Archon himself and can bring peace and good luck, as well as serve as a protective amulet. Coins with the Sign of Vaisravana are used as a lucky charm to prevent disaster and bring favor and are quite popular with business owners hoping for peace and prosperity. Coins with the sun symbol symbolize peace and harmony, and the symbol of the cross represents growth, prosperity, and balance between heaven and earth. Coins with the peace symbol symbolize safe passage, and those with the yardstick symbol represent success. In addition, some coins can symbolize career growth, incoming riches, family fortune, and spirit and vigor.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

During the Traveler's first Lantern Rite, with the assistance of Xiao, Kaeya, and the Millelith, the Traveler and Paimon successfully thwarted a laughable yet problematic plot involving the Treasure Hoarders.

Thus, for the second Lantern Rite Festival, Liyue had made improvements to firecrackers to be used for the fireworks show to commercialize the tenacious spirit of their ancestors. The Ministry of Civil Affairs had placed fireworks displays all over Liyue and planned to set them all off at the same time at a certain point during the festival so that the sparkling lights could bring joy to people's hearts."

They first visited Madame Ping, an Adeptus also known by her Adeptal name Streetward Rambler, and Yanfei, one of the best legal advisers of Liyue and a half-Adeptus, who was with Madame Ping at Yuehai Pavilion when they met her. They also made a gift for Cloud Retainer, who was coincidentally visited by another half-Adeptus, Ganyu, and Cloud Retainer's disciple, Shenhe. Cloud Retainer took a rather high interest in the fireworks launch tube, as the device had an original design and was aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

The reason for Xiao's attitude towards the Lantern Rite dates back to dark times after the Archon War when the lands of Liyue were plagued by pestilence and famine. Many Liyue festivals coincide with occasions where demons were defeated by Adepti. People started to imitate their deeds and stage exorcism rituals to remember their ancient heroism, with these practices eventually evolving into celebratory festivals. The hatred and residual might of many of the gods defeated by Morax throughout Liyue sometimes erupt with abnormal force amid their half-awake, half-dreaming state. Among them, the eruption that takes place during the Lantern Rite is the most extreme in scale. Xiao's mission is to perform the time-honored \"Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering,\" and so he fights night and day during the Lantern Rite. Thus, he has come to hate it.\nTrouble reached the group as fireworks delivered to Qingce Village were stolen and Keqing teamed up with Traveler, Paimon, and their old friends, Xingqiu and Chongyun, and managed to obtain the stolen fireworks carefully and apprehend the Treasure Hoarder group responsible for the theft. Thanks to everyone's help, the festival was a success, and people of Liyue from each corner were able to enjoy a peaceful and beautiful fireworks show."

        "text": "The history of the music festival dates back several generations, to a traveler from Fontaine, an ancestor of Dvorak. Once, as a traveler was wandering through Liyue, he slipped and fell into a lake, but as he was sinking and gasping for breath, he heard a wondrous tune in the air. They say it was the most beautiful, moving melody he had ever heard. Even in that life-and-death moment, the ethereal music seized his full attention and almost made him forget the fact that he was drowning. When he finally came to, he found that he had already been brought ashore. Not too far from him stood an unfamiliar woman with an almost divine aura. Once she saw that he was no longer in danger, she left without a word. The traveler tried to run after her to show his gratitude. But although a mere dozen paces separated them, no matter how quickly he gave chase, he drew no closer and remained a dozen paces behind. In the end, all he could do was to bow in thanks to the woman as he watched her walk away towards the rivers and mountains in the distance, before at last he turned around and made his way home. Once he returned to Fontaine, he began to learn an instrument, so that he could spread his story far and wide, just like the bards. After generations of retelling, embellishing, and dramatizing, people have come to think of that lady as something like a fairy. The story became something of a local legend in Fontaine, commonly known as \"The Lady Overlooking the Lake.\" They now say that if you go down to the lakeside and play an instrument, so long as you play a pleasing melody, you will hear a fairy lady, who is hiding out of sight, playing along with you.\nMany years later, Dvorak, the traveler's descendant, wanted to find out the truth of this tale. He decided to retrace his ancestor's steps and search for that lady's modern-day descendants. He spent many years on the road, and the wish that he had spent half his life chasing after had become something of an obsession. Once, Dvorak prayed for the Anemo Archon's guidance in the Mondstadt Cathedral, and as soon as he set foot back outside the front gate, he noticed a cluster of leaves being blown in the wind, further and further west, towards Stone Gate. A friendly local told him that this meant the wind was guiding him in the direction of Liyue, so Dvorak followed their advice and made his way there."

She could often be found sitting alone at a mountain summit, contemplating and reminiscing with her zither. The music would go from mournful, to soothing, to impassioned.

Hu Tao invited her friends to the feast: Xiangling, Chongyun, and Xingqiu; her consultant Zhongli, and the special guest — Adeptus Xiao. During the feast, Chongyun, an exorcist, said that Xiao had always been an example for him since the exorcists' clan had worked together with the Demon Slayer for centuries. In addition to the exorcists, members of the Funeral Parlor also worked alongside the Great Yakshas. In the time of the Archon War, disputes were frequent, and disaster overtook the land. Humans couldn't escape from the torment of the plague, nor could they escape death. The Adepti vanquished the demons, the Milleliths fought valiantly, and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor was responsible for purifying the diseased and sending off the spirits of the dead. This is how the border between life and death was maintained during the war, and it effectively prevented further incidents from happening."

Xiao reported that while patrolling Dihua Marsh, he met Venti, who was putting on a performance there. It was Venti's music that once saved Xiao when he was ready to give up on karma and suffering. This touching melody made Xiao feel relaxed and at ease. It turned out that Venti learned about the Lantern Rite Musical Festival in Liyue and could not resist the temptation to attend it.\nZhongli and Venti , the Geo Archon Morax and the Anemo Archon Barbatos, skillfully played their roles as a Funeral Parlor consultant and a simple bard, who were strangers to each other and to Xiao. They recalled previous stories: how Zhongli once ordered tea with the most complex name at a Mondstadt tavern; and how in Mondstadt they speak of a bard with exquisite taste. Venti and Hu Tao became close over their love of poetry, which led them to later jointly organize a Poetry Gala in which the residents of Mondstadt and Liyue participated.\nDuring the meeting, Hu Tao decided to give the honor of lighting the incense to the most honored guest. The ritual of burning incense was supposed to bring growth and prosperity to all endeavors in the new year. After numerous discussions about the honorable role, all the guests chose Paimon, who was familiar with everyone present. Others saw Paimon as the best companion of the Traveler and the key to the success of their travels, so it was she who was given the honor of lighting the incense.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "The main theme of the fifth of the Traveler and Paimon's Lantern Rite was the Eight Adepts and the Sanctification of Tao Dou. During the Archon War, there was a divine mountain in Liyue with a giant tree on its summit. This tree was a god named \"Tao Dou,\" originally known as \"Bune.\" Back then, people thought that behind Tao Dou was the realm of the dead, and if you committed grave sins in life, your soul would be unable to pass beyond that tree and into the afterlife. About two to three thousand years ago, the Eight Adepts rose up — eight people and beasts who laid down a great magic array to purify Tao Dou. He cared greatly for all living things and volunteered to sanctify himself to pacify the underworld. Without the god's will not even eight Adepti would have been able to overpower him, much less the Eight Adepts. Tao Dou was sealed in a secret palace in the Qingce Mountains called the \"Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula\" along with other evil spirits, and the palace itself was enchanted using the Seven-Eight Gates method. After that, Tao Dou's remains sank into the Ley Lines and became a border, separating the living of Liyue from the dead in Liyue. The mortals continued to preserve and maintain the god's new form for thousands of years.\nAmong the Eight Adepts, there were three joined forces: the Three Hermits of Guizang, the Two Sages of Lianshan, and the Three Beasts of Tao Dou. Although they possessed powers comparable to those of the Adepti, many of them were ordinary mortals. One of the hermits was called \"Wind Reader,\" he came from the Twelve Tribes of the Chenyu Vale, and his descendants became the founders of the Lan clan and the ancient art of Qimen Divination. The second hermit mastered the art of fishing with a rod and line, and became known to the people as the \"Yunlai Angler.\" It is believed that the Yunlai Swordsmanship that the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing, uses was based on the Yunlai Angler's rod-wielding techniques. The third hermit was the Wuwang Kid, also known as Old Man Wuwang. According to legend, he always presented himself in child form and was a master of Qihuang sigils, which he used to catch demons, heal disease, and protect lives from the encroaching presence of death."

Little is known about them, but they were known to have mastered the secret art of Lianshan, earning them the title of the Two Sages of Lianshan. A hidden palace is located deep in the mountains south of the Stone Gate. It is believed to be where they retreated for cultivation. The Three Beasts of Tao Dou, also known as the Three Immortals of Tao Dou, lived on the mountain where the divine tree grew. They were known as the Lone Butterfly of the Crimson Flame, the Jade-Plumed\nand the Gold-Eyed Celadon Mare. These were three auspicious beasts, all with the power to take on human form. During Tao Dou's purification ceremony, the Lone Butterfly sacrificed herself, Silverwing and Wind Reader traveled together, and the white horse went to live in seclusion in the Qingce mountain range. Although they all had remarkable powers, purifying a god of Tao Dou's caliber was no mean feat. They had to use the secret art of the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Array, which involved obfuscating one of the gates so that evil couldn't escape. The Lone Butterfly was in charge of the hidden gate that was chosen to be obfuscated, and so she disappeared from the world in the process. According to legend, Old Man Wuwang looked up to her a lot, took up her mantle, and kept her legacy alive, passing it on to the founders of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Thus, the Butterfly sacrificed her life to restore order to the realm of the dead, some chance meetings ensured that future generations continued using her methods to guard the border between life and death. Although she disappeared from the world, her mission to protect Liyue is still alive and well, thousands of years on."

The symptoms of all the patients were accelerated aging. A couple of weeks later, Hu Tao, the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, reported a possible disturbance at the border separating the world of the living and the dead, so the Ministry launched an investigation and discovered problems on Wuwang Hill. Twelve years ago, there was an incident at the border, and Hu Tao's father, the director of the funeral parlor at the time, tried to use the special Art of Homa to burn away the fetor seeping through the border, he slipped up and suffered a lethal exposure to it. His mistake didn't just cost him his own life — it took most of the village out and left lasting changes on Wuwang Hill itself. Twelve years later, his daughter went to eliminate the fetor from entering the world of the living but was stuck on the border. The zombie, Qiqi, who was gathering herbs on Wuwang Hill, and Lan Yan from Chenyu Vale, who had gone after Hu Tao, were trapped with her. Every time Director Hu found a way out of the border, it would change. Only with the help of the Conqueror of Demons and the Traveler, who was sent to save Hu Tao by the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, Ningguang, did the three return to the world of the living."

The eight gates refer to eight key nodes in Liyue's Ley Lines: Life, Death, Repose, Concealment, Initiation, Terrain, Fright, and Injury. They can be used to direct the Ley Lines' energy. The seven gates are the requirement for activating the array. The array master will select one gate from the eight to subdue evil, cutting off its exit path by using the Ley Lines' power to obfuscate themselves. The gate would disappear from the Ley Lines completely, never to be seen again — taking the banished evil along with them. Although traditional interpretations said that someone had to sacrifice themselves for the ritual to work, Hu Tao insisted that as long as the master could withstand the powerful release of the fetor, everything would be fine."

The Gate of Concealment, a place of refuge, peace, and good fortune, was located on Mt. Aocang, where the Adeptus Cloud Retainer resided. The half-Adeptus, Ganyu, and the Cloud Retainer's disciple, Shenhe, were tasked with protecting this gate.

It's as if I could feel the vigorous vitality emanating from it just by looking at the buildings in the city from a distance. When I strolled through the city, I could see the fleet of ships gradually approaching from afar. You can often see smoke rising from the stove in food stalls, accompanied by the enticing aroma of piping-hot food. The fragrance alone was enough to make my stomach growl. Even if one is just wandering around the streets, one can always find all kinds of precious treasures in the shops...\nOf course, as a merchant, the goods I bring can always be exchanged here for a satisfactory price. This time, I came during Liyue's Lantern Rite, so the entire Liyue Harbor seemed much busier than usual. Everyone's faces were filled with excitement that could not be concealed, and even the Millelith patrolling the city looked less solemn than usual. The fabrics I brought were quickly sold out. Some people even purchased all of the most expensive ones, praising the bright colors, the softness and lightness of the golden threads woven into them, which shimmer in the light of the Lantern Rite.\nIf I were to say that Liyue Harbor on an ordinary day seemed as stable and full of life as the mountains, then during the Lantern Rite Festival, its beauty is as brilliant as the lights all over the city during this time. When I was a child, I liked to pester the old businessman in the caravan, listening to him talk about the customs and culture of various places. Naturally, I've also heard about the customs of the Lantern Rite - the people of Liyue will release Xiao Lanterns across the sea of stars to guide heroic souls back home. They also use this time of the year as a day to bid farewell to the old and welcome the new. People would pray for good luck in the new year and write their wishes on the Xiao Lanterns. Liyue will also set up the \"Mingxiao Lantern\" at this time. Different from ordinary lanterns, it is said that this lantern is made by the people of Liyue to commemorate the adepti. This lantern is filled with lights and reaches several stories high. The view from a distance is an extremely gorgeous one. With its lights remaining illuminated all night, the Mingxiao Lantern is one of the most stunning sights at the Lantern Rite Festival."

That night, the entire Liyue Harbor was illuminated by bright lights like it was daytime. People came and went between the streets and alleys, their laughter lighting up the city. Looking at the harbor in the distance, there were countless Xiao Lanterns slowly rising to the sky, twinkling like stars. The first firework burst into the sky, and cheers erupted from the crowd. Then, the fireworks burst into the sky one after another, painting a breathtaking scene. I've been traveling for many years, and pride myself on being well-informed, but such a fireworks show is a rare sight."

Near them, there was a young girl dressed in white holding a Xiao Lantern with the help of her companions. She closed her eyes and prayed sincerely, a smile etched on the corners of her lips... In the crowd who came to watch the lanterns, I even saw my business partner. It wasn't a good time to talk business. After wishing each other a happy Lantern Rite, we looked at each other and smiled, and continued to immerse ourselves in the atmosphere of Lantern Rite.\nI wonder what kind of surprises the next Lantern Rite will hold?"
