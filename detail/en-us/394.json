I clearly remember telling him that.\nPerhaps the streak of unfortunate incidents we've encountered in the past few days has caused me to turn bitter.\nOr perhaps this is simply the natural toll such desperate conditions take on people.\nThe fact that Master Eberhart could maintain a level head even in the face of such adverse conditions only made him all the more admirable. Perhaps this is the true tenacity of a young aristocrat.\nMaster Landrich's judgment seems to have been well-founded.\nEven as an illegitimate child, he is quite capable of living up to the role of an aristocrat, more so than most other aristocrats, in fact.\nWhen the storm eases a little, we will proceed to the <color=#ffe14b>the cellar in the southwestern ruins</color> as per Eberhart's proposal.\nBased on the content of what he deciphered, there may be something very ancient within.\nThe sheer cold of this place has the peculiar and incomprehensible effect of preserving things the way they are.\nWe must not let down the companions we lost.\n...And more importantly, we must not let Master Landrich down.\nOtherwise, I will most likely be facing off against monsters in the gladiatorial arena before too long.\nEven if I beat the monsters, I would probably share the fate of Eberhart's slave, and meet my demise at the sword of the red-haired reaper of the Lawrence Clan..."
