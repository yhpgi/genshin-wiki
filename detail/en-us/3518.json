Once he created a suit for Bosacius, but the four-armed Yaksha did not appreciate it, since the suit had only two sleeves. Menogias possessed a singular talent for clothing design. He had an exquisite eye not just for fabric selection and color pairing, but also for what accessories could best accentuate a garment's overall styling. At a gathering of Adepti, Bonanus once complained in secret to some of the ladies in attendance that the skirt Menogias made for her was too long and impractical, lamenting that it would only hinder her in battle. However, when Cloud Retainer asked Menogias his opinion, he remarked that the train of the skirt would serve to enhance Bonanus's Adeptal countenance by exemplifying a certain elegance. When it came to topics relating to garments and accessories, not even Rex Lapis could best his stubbornness."

Menogias was commemorated during the fourth Lantern Rite that the Traveler and Paimon attended. The main theme of the festival was \"Kites,\" and Menogias's friends, Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper, remembered that he was so skilled in matters of craftsmanship, that kite-making would scarcely prove to be a test of his capabilities. Were he yet amongst the living, he could have opened a kite stall, which would have been an establishment rich not only in profit but also esteem. And if, as in the past, he was unable to involve himself in matters of the mortal realm, Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper could sell the kites in his stead. Thus, talking about how they would celebrate success together in wonderful company with a wine, the Adepti were content with joyful memories and enjoyed the beauty of Liyue Harbor for Menogias.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
