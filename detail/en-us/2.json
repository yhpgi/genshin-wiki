However, additional danger means an additional workload — and that is something that she would never be able to accept."

How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?\nPut off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.\nSince then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.\n\"Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask.\"\nThese words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt.

I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\"\nAnd just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.\nWith the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.\nFor whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.\nThe Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.\nSo, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.\nPerhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions."
