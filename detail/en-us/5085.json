When people came to the vale along with their goddess and her two servants, Herblord and Fujin, Fujin defeated the Suanni. Instead of killing her, Fujin and Herblord befriended Lingyuan, who became known to the people as the Mountain Lord. Fujin planted the first tea tree on Lingyuan's mountain, the branches of which people then grafted to the other side of the river. Although Lingyuan was angry at such insolence, she could already imagine the aroma of the tea that she would drink with her friends.\nIn those distant times, Lingyuan, together with Fujin and Herblord, took on human form. One day, Lingyuan accidentally drank the celebratory libations and hauled forest boars in to ask them \"Who's prettier, me or Herblord?\" Another time, she ate too many teacakes at the temple fair and came crying to Herblord asking to make her some slimming tea, because she didn't know that a human form created by Adeptal energy can never gain weight. After Herblord left Chenyu Vale and Fujin lost all her powers, Lingyuan decided to never take on human form again."

Little Mao was playing in the mountains one time and saw a rabbit that couldn't move because of a rock that was on top of it. He removed that rock and gave it some fruits, although the rabbit did not eat, but only nodded at him before hopping into the forest. It rained heavily later on that day, and Little Mao couldn't find his way home, so he hid under a big rock, where Lingyuan found him. In response to the boy's kindness to the rabbit, the Suanni brought him fruits and guided him out of the mountains. Later, she allowed Mao to call herself Bluey, and began to show him different places, treat him to fruits and tell him stories of the past. If Mao lost something, she asked the birds to help him, and they found the lost things in the forest. Although the mountains of the valley are dangerous, she always protects the boy.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
