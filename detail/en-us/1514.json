However, her conditions were extremely unique, and my medical abilities aren't sufficient to establish a diagnosis... All I can do is come up with this theory based on my instincts. It seems that the energies of the Tatarigami did not corrupt her. Instead, they flow freely inside of her. The patient's mind and body were not affected, but the consistent fever and the small amount of occasional bleeding are extremely hard to control...\n...Though these symptoms are not lethal, I cannot be sure that they are not contagious...\n...Perhaps only the hospitals in Sumeru would have a cure for this...\n...\n...I've given her directions, and told her where she will find the pirates. Uncle Onitaka may be greedy for riches, but he is also a righteous soul. He should be willing to help her...\n...She has a child by the name of Chouji. I will take good care of him once this is all over...\n...But I can't go to find him right now. It is not the right time yet..."
