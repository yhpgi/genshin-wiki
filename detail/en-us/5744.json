They were once people of great esteem in Khaenri'ah, those who carried the hopes of the nation. According to the plan, the six of them were supposed to prevent a catastrophe and stop the Vinster King from continuing to rock the foundation of the world. But deep down, five of them wanted more and could not resist the call of the Abyss, so they divided the power capable of destroying the entire world among themselves. Vedrfolnir, Rhinedottir, Hroptatyr, Rerir, and Surtalogi became the Sinners — transcendent beings, each in possession of world-shattering power. And when disaster struck, only Dainsleif stood up to protect his people. When King Irmin and the sages tore the veil of sin, and monsters from the Abyss created by Rhinedottir filled Teyvat, the Heavenly Principles sent the Archons of the seven kingdoms to Khaenri'ah, and the nation without gods itself was destroyed."

Under the curse of immortality, the Black Serpent Knights under the Twilight Sword's command lost their minds and memories, turning into empty husks that only had the will to destroy the enemy and defend. Unlike his comrades, Dainsleif was able to retain his mind using the ring left by his brother, although his body is gradually eroded, his memories fade, and he is forced to watch as the people he was supposed to protect are transformed into monsters of the Abyss. Due to the process of erosion, the Twilight Sword is forced to wear a mask, and part of his body is covered in traces of the curse. He swore vengeance on the five Sinners of Khaenri'ah, even if all memories were erased from his mind."

He also fought in a battle near Tunigi Hollow in the northernmost part of the desert, where the monsters emerged to the surface. Many knights of Khaenri'ah, people of Sumeru, and Pari gave their lives, and when the battle was over, the first Pari, Zurvan, found Dainsleif clutching a ring tightly in his hand. She returned with him to the Vourukasha Oasis, the homeland of the Pari, and after he awoke, they traveled together for some time, fighting the monsters that had invaded the oasis. As the monsters gradually disappeared from the face of the earth, Dainsleif and the Princess/Prince of Khaenri'ah set out on a journey to confront fate. Dainsleif first saw the Princess/Prince when he was still a young knight, and King Irmin announced a new heir. Gradually, the Princess/Prince was used as a vessel by which unlimited Abyssal power could be absorbed and became the key to the world's near-annihilation."

In an attempt to cure their illegitimate son, Caribert, who had turned into a hilichurl, Chlothar and the Princess/Prince turned to the\nwho was able to temporarily restore Caribert's sanity. Alberich hoped that with the\nCaribert could become the \"Loom of Fate\" and weave his fate anew. Although the boy was not destined to survive, the idea of ​​the \"Loom of Fate\" was born in the thoughts of Chlothar and the Princess/Prince, so she/he didn't tell Dainsleif about the meeting with Alberich. Alberich later became the founder of the Abyss Order, which was joined by former Khaenri'ahns who became monsters of the Abyss. The monsters that serve the Abyss are the fangs and claws with which the Order sows chaos on this land. The Abyss is destruction and a morass of inconceivable madness that encroaches upon this world's very foundations. The goal of the Order was the overthrow of a world ruled by the Archons. Over time, Dainsleif's companion joined the Order, considering Dainsleif her/his enemy. In succession, she/he became known as the Princess/Prince of the Abyss Order. In turn, the Twilight Sword began to fight against the Abyss Order and the power they used to prevent them from betraying the entire world."

When the Twilight Sword was later chasing another Abyss Herald, he traveled through this network and ended up in the depths of the Chasm. Realizing that the Abyss Order needed a teleportation node in this place for some reason, he decided to explore the place and met the Traveler and Paimon, who were investigating the strange behavior of the Hilichurls. The Chasm miners noticed that they were going deep into the mines as if in a trance and never returned. The investigation led the Traveler and Paimon to an upside-down city of an ancient civilization, similar in architecture to Khaenri'ah, but much older. Near the upside-down city, Dainsleif felt that the surrounding environment was weakening the curse placed on him and the Hilichurls. For centuries, he had suffered daily from the curse, but there he suddenly felt a small amount of relief from this suffering. The curse of immortality denied death to those afflicted with it, but the body and soul would continue to be eroded until they were virtually nonexistent, even if \"death\" is not the form that this erosion took. When the hilichurls realized that the end was nigh for them, they instinctively sought a calm and dark place to say goodbye to centuries of suffering, and a place where the power of the curse weakened was best suited for this."

Inside the upside-down city, they encountered other Black Serpent Knights, who were protecting the hilichurls, whose end was near. The familiar knight appeared again and ordered the others to retreat, and Dainsleif recognized him as Halfdan, once a young warrior of the royal guard. On the day of Khaenri'ah's fall, the Twilight Sword had ordered Halfdan to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs, and even after the Cataclysm and the corruption of the curse, the guards continued to carry out this order. In the upper levels of the city, Dainsleif and the Traveler discovered an upside-down fountain, the water of which had a \"cleansing\" effect and weakened the curse. But even the fountain could not completely remove the curse: it was woven into the fate of the world itself, and existed on a higher level of reality than the person themselves."

Near one of the hilichurls, the Traveler found an Inteyvat flower, the Khaenri'ah national flower, which once bloomed in all corners of the nation. Its bloom lasted only two weeks, and if the flower was picked and taken away from Khaenri'ah, the petals stopped growing and hardened. Only after the flower returned to its native soil did the petals become soft again and eventually turn to dust. To the people of Khaenri'ah, the Inteyvat was a symbol for a wanderer far from home, signifying the tenderness of the homeland. In addition, this flower was worn in Lumine's hair. Upon touching the flower, the Traveler saw their twin discussing the ritual to revive Khaenri'ah with the Abyss Herald using the device underneath the fountain. Dainsleif was certain that the revival of his homeland and the lifting of the curse were impossible, and attempting to forcibly dispel it would only lead to more suffering. The Traveler agreed, so they hurried to stop the Abyss Order from trampling the will of Halfdan and the other Black Serpent Knights."

Although they expected the process to free them from the curse, the hilichurls, Black Serpent Knights, and Dainsleif himself experienced only extreme pain. Despite the immense suffering, Halfdan rushed to the device and stopped the process by sacrificing himself. But even after Halfdan's sacrifice, the device remained activated. After all the power supply mechanisms were destroyed, the device was finally turned off, but Halfdan no longer had any life left. As Dainsleif was about to leave, Halfdan's spirit regained its senses for a moment and was able to bid farewell to the Twilight Sword, dissolving without a trace.\nThe ritual performed by the Abyss Order had greatly weakened Dainsleif, so it took him time to recover. But even despite the suffering, he could not rest, as the Loom of Fate project was still active, and the amplifying devices in the Chasm could be connected to it.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The house belonged to Chlothar Alberich, who was trying to heal his son, Caribert.

After founding the Abyss Order, Chlothar's faith in it drove him to do many things, but the curse of immortality endlessly tormented his body and spirit, and the Abyss he believed in ultimately failed to save him. A hundred years later, he finally lost his mind and disappeared, but his dark legacy lived on, and the inverted statue that Dainsleif and the Traveler saw in Liyue was just one of the mysterious creations of his Abyss power. After seeing it, the Traveler decided to dig up the field near the house, where they found the remains of Caribert's mother and Chlothar himself, who had somehow managed to lift the curse."

The next morning, the Twilight Sword suddenly had memories of the missing boy that he had never had before. In these memories, he gave the boy the eye of the first Field Tiller, which he had hidden from the Abyss Order for a long time. In order to check if the Field Tiller's eye was still there, they went to the ruins of an ancient civilization near the village. Deep in the ruins, they were attacked by the Abyss Herald, and Dainsleif, sensing a change in the Ley Lines, sent the Traveler and Paimon back to find the missing person.

By the time the guards reacted, the front line was destroyed, and the monsters retreated in the direction of the Cinder City, where their main headquarters would be located. Since the Twilight Sword could not wait for reinforcements from the Natlanese, he, along with the Traveler, went to Ochkanatlan to find out the true motive of the Order. During his hunt for the Abyss Order in Natlan, Dainsleif interrogated several of the Order's captured monsters, but he was unable to find out anything, so he decided to focus on military action. If the Order was willing to sacrifice all of its strength to carry out a secret plan, the Twilight Sword wanted to make their sacrifice as tangible as possible."

After his defeat, the Baptist revealed that the Princess/Prince of the Abyss Order had already achieved victory, and the rest of the Order's task was to attract attention to themselves. The Princess/Prince had quietly infiltrated the Night Kingdom and used Natlan's experience of restoring the Ley Lines to create the Atlas of the New World — a recreation of the Khaenri'ah Ley Lines from five hundred years ago using the Loom of Fate."

Although they were unable to kill each other due to the curse of immortality, Dainsleif still longed to kill him a hundred times over. During his time as a teacher at the Academy, Haden brutally suppressed the next generation of knights to maintain his reputation, and even Dainsleif's fellow student, Surtalogi, was maimed because of him. But five hundred years later, due to erosion and the power of the Abyss, Haden's memories, personality, soul, and feelings had long been erased, and he could not remember anything. He asked his former student to share the memories of their home, as the Twilight Sword was the only one able to retain memories through the ring. And although Dainsleif would not share the stories of Khaenri'ah, he opened his memories to the Loom of Fate, which is what the Abyss Order wanted. With the memories of almost the entire Order having faded by the erosion, they needed Dainsleif's memories to create a new Khaenri'ah from. When the Twilight Sword realized that Haden lied that the Loom of Fate was completed and that his own memories became the key element of the mechanism, he promised Haden a hundred more deaths for his deception.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
