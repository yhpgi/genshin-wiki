When his older brother, Vedrfolnir, was blinded in both eyes and imprisoned for giving an oracle, Dainsleif gathered the brilliant young ones of the age, \"The Wise\" Hroptatyr, \"The Visionary\" Vedrfolnir, \"Gold\" Rhinedottir, \"The Foul\" Surtalogi, and \"Rächer of Solnari\" Rerir, to save him. They were once people of great esteem in Khaenri'ah, those who carried the hopes of the nation. According to the plan, the six of them were supposed to prevent a catastrophe and stop the Vinster King from continuing to rock the foundation of the world. But deep down, five of them wanted more and could not resist the call of the Abyss, so they divided the power capable of destroying the entire world among themselves. Vedrfolnir, Rhinedottir, Hroptatyr, Rerir, and Surtalogi became the Sinners — transcendent beings, each in possession of world-shattering power. And when disaster struck, only Dainsleif stood up to protect his people. When King Irmin and the sages tore the veil of sin, and monsters from the Abyss created by Rhinedottir filled Teyvat, the Heavenly Principles sent the Archons of the seven kingdoms to Khaenri'ah, and the nation without gods itself was destroyed."

Under the curse of immortality, the Black Serpent Knights under the Twilight Sword's command lost their minds and memories, turning into empty husks that only had the will to destroy the enemy and defend. Unlike his comrades, Dainsleif was able to retain his mind using the ring left by his brother, although his body is gradually eroded, his memories fade, and he is forced to watch as the people he was supposed to protect are transformed into monsters of the Abyss. Due to the process of erosion, the Twilight Sword is forced to wear a mask, and part of his body is covered in traces of the curse. He swore vengeance on the five Sinners of Khaenri'ah, even if all memories were erased from his mind."

He also fought in a battle near Tunigi Hollow in the northernmost part of the desert, where the monsters emerged to the surface. Many knights of Khaenri'ah, people of Sumeru, and Pari gave their lives, and when the battle was over, the first Pari, Zurvan, found Dainsleif clutching a ring tightly in his hand. She returned with him to the Vourukasha Oasis, the homeland of the Pari, and after he awoke, they traveled together for some time, fighting the monsters that had invaded the oasis. As the monsters gradually disappeared from the face of the earth, Dainsleif and the Princess/Prince of Khaenri'ah set out on a journey to confront fate. Dainsleif first saw the Princess/Prince when he was still a young knight, and King Irmin announced a new heir. Gradually, the Princess/Prince was used as a vessel by which unlimited Abyssal power could be absorbed and became the key to the world's near-annihilation."

He immediately recognized the Princess/Prince, but did not want to reveal his true identity, so he introduced himself under a false name. In an attempt to cure their illegitimate son, Caribert, who had turned into a hilichurl, Chlothar and the Princess/Prince turned to the Sinner (Vedrfolnir), who was able to temporarily restore Caribert's sanity. Alberich hoped that with the power of the Sinner (Abyssal power), Caribert could become the \"Loom of Fate\" and weave his fate anew. Although the boy was not destined to survive, the idea of ​​the \"Loom of Fate\" was born in the thoughts of Chlothar and the Princess/Prince, so she/he didn't tell Dainsleif about the meeting with Alberich. Alberich later became the founder of the Abyss Order, which was joined by former Khaenri'ahns who became monsters of the Abyss. The monsters that serve the Abyss are the fangs and claws with which the Order sows chaos on this land. The Abyss is destruction and a morass of inconceivable madness that encroaches upon this world's very foundations. The goal of the Order was the overthrow of a world ruled by the Archons. Over time, Dainsleif's companion joined the Order, considering Dainsleif her/his enemy. In succession, she/he became known as the Princess/Prince of the Abyss Order. In turn, the Twilight Sword began to fight against the Abyss Order and the power they used to prevent them from betraying the entire world."

After that, he inquired about special forging materials from the blacksmith, Wagner, but the latter had not even heard of such materials. A suspicious man with blonde hair and a blindfold was seen in the Angels' Share tavern, where the Traveler went to find out about the stranger. When they met, Dainsleif asked for five hundred Mora and answers to three questions. First, he asked who played a key role in the victory together with the Anemo Archon over the Stormterror. The second question was, <color=#ffffffd9>\"Rex Lapis, who has defended Liyue Harbor for millennia on end, used his Gnosis to lay down a Contract to End All Contracts, of which the stipulations are still unknown.
