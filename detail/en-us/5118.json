Having waited for an auspicious day, the people would cease their onerous labors, and sacrifice their beautiful jade, throwing it into the water as respect. When the ancient god who once ruled Chenyu Vale had perished in foreign lands, and Rex Lapis's order assumed control of the land, those ancient forebears amidst their mountainous wilds slowly accepted the civilization of Liyue and lost the ancient art of carving jade jewelry. Today, only some artisans of Yilong Port still make such jade ornaments.\nYilong\nis located north of Chenyu Vale and is one of the most important trading ports in the region, connecting Liyue and Fontaine. During one of the Lantern Rite Festivals, customers could buy Sunglo tea here with a fifty percent discount when buying 10 boxes.

The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing, went to Yilong Wharf to use the power of the gate and Director Hu's rattan figure to take on some of the fetor blast for her. In this way, the load would be distributed among all the gates, and Hu Tao would remain alive.

Now the hall is in decline and desolation, and only a few disciples of the Guhua Clan are trying to preserve the memory of the old days.\nAccording to the village elders, the people of Mt. Lingmeng once worshipped many supernatural beings, walking alongside the spirit elders of fairies, birds, and beasts within the wild mountain. But in the earth-shaking chaotic war with the second who came a thousand years before, those gods, fairies, and former inhabitants alike disappeared. Only the Ley Lines retained the echoing memories, and thus they sometimes repeatedly reappear at dawn or at night, when fog and rain blanket the land. Sometimes, herb gatherers and jade artisans will lose their way in this fog and encounter these solitary shadows. The village elders say that encountering the ancient fallen is often an ill-starred omen, a sign of unexpected disaster. The Ley Lines bring forth these ancient regrets and miseries into the present world, and that is why there is fog and rain unceasing. That is why the mountain people avoid both like the plague, to avoid becoming entangled in spirit by those ancient sorrows.\nWhen the Archon War just ended, a mariner once entered the crisscrossed streams beneath Mt. Lingmeng and became lost in the damp dusk fog. Following azure avians never before seen even in dreams, he came into the cavern of slumber. Through the jade glow, the mariner gazed at the inhabitants of old. Lined up and standing on the bank of a deep pool, they sang a song the mariner had never heard before:"

According to legend, this was caused by an ancient pact between the Adepti of the Vale. In Chenyu Vale, people believe that tea tasting is closer to a ritual people practice after a busy day to relieve themselves of the bustle and clear their minds. Each type of tea has its own traditions. Yunlai White Tea is shaped like a silver needle and should not be brewed with boiling water. The water must be allowed to cool until it's at 70% of its boiling temperature. First, wet the tea with some hot water, then pour an appropriate amount of water into the pot, and wait patiently for ten minutes until the tea turns a light amber hue. Only then should you take a sip. The brewing steps are reversed for Bishui Green Tea. It requires pouring the water first, then the tea leaves. A Single-Origin Yauwan Tea, one of the teas Chenyu Vale is famous for, requires brewing at high temperatures. Boiling water must be used after letting it stand for a short moment."

There's a legend saying that the jade scattered among the rocks came from the azure heavens. Celestia's envoys bestowed these beauteous gems upon the early residents and guided them to build a ritual jade altar that reached the heavens, so that they may receive the blessings and curses from above. While migrating from the south, people left many mighty temples and brought the ritual jade to Chiwang Terrace in Chenyu Vale. The jade tower is no more, and only silent, ancient ruins stand amidst the thick fog that shrouds the mountains, watching over a secret none now shall know. Later on, many tribes that descended from these ancestors kept this primordial, simple faith, and their reverence for jade was merged into the Liyue tradition, shaping the culture we see today."

They say that she wore a skirt of coagulated jade-blood, and leaned on the long-destroyed lunar chariot, submerged and slumbering beneath a black, bottomless pool of water. Before the Archon War, she was the mistress of Chenyu Vale, who ruled the birds, beasts, and Adepti of wild mountain nature, who controlled the ebb and flow of the Bishui River, as an arbiter maintained the natural balance between mortals and animals. Two Adepti served this demon lord from the past: Herblord, whose real appearance was a white snake with golden eyes, and Fujin, a golden carp. One day, Fujin defeated the ancient Suanni, Lingyuan, known as the Mountain Lord, who lived in the vale before the arrival of the people. Fujin did not kill the Suanni but became her friend along with Herblord. Although Lingyuan did not like people, she allowed Fujin to perform the Rainjade Rite, which changed the ley lines and elemental energy so that people could live in the vale. Because of these changes, even the tea growing in Qiaoying Village began to taste something that people would like."

        "text": "Qiaoying Village is the only place in Liyue, where tea trees can grow, so it's famous for its tea business. People from the village believe that the Carp-Adeptus, Fujin, planted the first tea tree, so they held tea ceremonies in gratitude to this Adeptus. To help the village, Cloud Retainer once made a special cauldron, which has three connected monoliths specially designed to prevent chaotic elemental energy. One day, these three mechanisms started acting strangely, and tea masters invited a researcher from Fontaine, Hautemontagne, to investigate the problem. Thanks to her and the Traveler's help, elemental flow in the monoliths was restored, and the cauldron was repaired, allowing the village to start making tea again.\nChenyu Vale is famous not only for its tea but also for its crafts. Silver-smithing, jade-carving, cloth-dying, rattan-weaving, and countless other crafts — Chenyu Vale is famed as the home of the most outstanding and accomplished artisans in each field. Skilled, dextrous, and creative are but a few words that could be used to describe them. Many of these artisans have lived and worked together for generations, honing their crafts in the picturesque hamlet of Qiaoying Village. The village tradespeople chose to form a collective to protect their shared interests and now proudly announce themselves as members of the Chenyu Vale Artisans Association, spreading prestige for their hometown and their skills everywhere they go. Members of the association not only look out for each other in crafting and trade, but they form a close-knit, neighborly group who are always there for each other in good times and in bad.\nWhen it comes time for the residents of Chenyu Vale to spruce up their homes, there is more than just the usual panoply of intricately carved wooden beds and tables on offer. They also have a fine selection of wickerwork furnishings to choose from — delicately crafted by their own master rattan weaver. The rattan weaving process consists of several stages: gathering the vines, processing them, and weaving them. Different vines are suitable for weaving different items. For example, a folding screen requires a certain stubborn resilience, while woven flower baskets, in contrast, require vines of a more supple nature. The most famous rattan weaver is a young girl named Lan Yan. Despite her youth, she excels at weaving all manner of rattan goods while also having a grasp on the arcane Qimen arts. It is said that <color=#ffffffd9>\"skills honed to the highest pinnacle produce art that touches the divine realm.\"</color> The venerable masters believe that anyone who reaches the apex of their craft will uncover abilities that cut through the spiritual divide. To them, Lan Yan — with her Vision and attunement to the Qimen arts — is a truly remarkable young woman."

        "text": "Much like the exorcists who dwell on Mt. Tianheng, the Lan clan, with their affinity for the Qimen arts, have long made Chenyu Vale their home. One such art requires the use of rattan figures, which is why weaving is so highly valued by the clan. The Lan family is also associated with the \"Eight Adepts,\" who are significant figures in Liyue's history and once fought against the god Tao Dou. Of these eight heroes, the Jade-Plumed Silverwing, Lone Butterfly of the Crimson Flame, and Gold-Eyed Celadon Mare are known as the Three Beasts of Tao Dou. Of the remaining five, Wind Reader, the Wuwang Kid, and the Yunlai Angler were honored as the Three Hermits of Guizang. They and the Two Sages of Lianshan were all human. The Jade-Plumed Silverwing had a deep connection with Wind Reader, who was a truly remarkable individual. He came from the Twelve Tribes of Chenyu Vale and was the first to teach the Lan clan the secrets of the Qimen arts. This art involves Pentad Fortune Conveyance and Fate Transference, so many people are suspicious of it. When the owner of the Feiyun Commerce Guild fell seriously ill and went into a coma during the Lantern Rite, a rattan doll made by the Lan clan was found in his room, and people thought that the doll was cold and caused the owner's illness. In fact, this doll was made by Lan Yan and had the Sign of Vaisravana, one of the four main exorcism sigils, on it. She hoped that the doll would protect the guild owner and other patients with similar symptoms from the fetor. In addition, the craftswoman created rattan dolls to serve as a barrier on the border between life and death, through which monsters would not penetrate. When the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Hu Tao, went to conduct a ritual that could clear the border and rid people of the fetor, Lan Yan made eight protective dolls in the form of Hu Tao and gave them to seven people to distribute the burden of the fetor and help the director.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

While he lived, bandits dared not act and the wilderness knew a peace like that of the city. At the end of his journey, Guhua ascended to the heavens in a purple haze and became a star. After the Grand Master passed away, Master Baixuan, who once received his favor, established the Guhua Brotherhood in his name and called himself a disciple of Guhua to carry on the grand master's legacy. The disciples founded Wangshan Hall, which was known before as the \"Lingmeng Chamber.\"\nIt was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts — the ways of the \"Light Piercer\" for polearms, \"Rain Cutter\" for swords, and \"Life Ender\" for those who excelled in both. It is said that \"Life Ender\" could slice wind, split waves, and destroy mountains. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence. The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor."
