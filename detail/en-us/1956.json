Unheard torture.\nAn all-engulfing sorrow crushed the poisoned Dvalin's spirit.\nDvalin turned on what he had vowed to protect,\nAnd accused the one to whom he had sworn loyalty:\n\"Indifferent is Barbatos to my pain! A careless friend is he!\"\n\"Curse you, Barbatos, cruelest of the Archons!\"\nThe furious friend knew not that Barbatos sought to save him.\nFor many fond memories may have been quashed by Dvalin's anguish, but not that of Barbatos' lyre. The Holy Lyre der Himmel.\nSoon, centuries of misunderstanding shall be gone.\nSoon, Dvalin shall hear once more his songs."
