It seems that all related information was erased alongside the sea of ash itself.\nThe only speculation that remains to be made comes from an ancient legend:\nThousands of years ago, a troupe wandered through the lands.\nFor flutes they had swords, and for harps they had bows. They performed for guests and also for foes.\"\nThey once traveled through the desert, and they also set foot in the blazing Mare Jivari.\nBut mainstream history dictates that the Mare Jivari only appeared five hundred years ago.\nAssuming the records of this ancient troupe in their heyday are accurate, it may suggest that a temporal disruption phenomenon occurred in the Mare Jivari.\nTemporal disruption... time...\nCould the transcendent power of the Abyss threaten even the flow of time?"
