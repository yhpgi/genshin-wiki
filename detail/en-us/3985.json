The once renowned Minister of the Navy had resigned with honors.\nPickman busied himself for many years attempting to persuade the Court of Fontaine to salvage and rebuild the \"Sponsian.\"\nBut his efforts were in vain, and the families of the fallen believed his efforts to rebuild the Fontainian Navy were little more than an attempt to fish for more glory...\nIn the end, the only thing remaining besides falsehoods and legends was this blue and white epee that once belonged to the Admiral.\n\"The 'Sponsian'? Awful name. What were you thinking, Pickman?\"\n\"The name of a usurper? Why, he and his dynasty may never have even existed—\"\n\"Anyway... I was just thinking aloud, y'know, and it just slipped out. Apologies, Captain.\"\n\"Relax, Pickman. You know what? Let's just call it that.\"\n\"That sense of unreal reality, I don't hate it.\"\nMany legends regarding the \"Sponsian\" and \"White Armada\" remained popular for some time after the destruction of the splendorous opera house,\nAnd they were staged at the newly-rebuilt opera house on Erinnyes to great success, until an accident put paid to such performances.\nOf them, the most memorable performance is the final battle of the armada: A heroic battle with a formidable barrage performed by ten battleship cannons onstage,\nWith the details having been reconstructed from the records of Basil Elton's First Mate.\nPerhaps Pickman did not think that absurd action worth writing down, just as he never once discussed it,\nOr perhaps the writers removed that detail from the script, feeling that it detracted from the intended epic tragedy,\nBut Basil Elton boarded the flagship once more after several years away, and muttered to Pickman and the other sailors:\n\"Looks like this time we can finally open fire on our enemies.\"\nIt was only after that she smiled and called out, as performed in the opera house:\n\"Well now, boys and girls! Can't do without me, I see! But if you wanna get nostalgic over tea, it'll have to wait!\"\n\"First, let's send that oversized punk who doesn't know what's what back down to the bottom of the waterfall!\""
