  "desc": "A mysterious mechanical being, much like a cat.<br>It is a gift from the Voynich Guild that was unearthed from an ancient ruin dating back to the pioneering age. According to an anonymous informant, the inscription at the excavation site once bore the word \"Ujola,\" but it weathered away shortly after being uncovered. To this day, the meaning of the name remains uncertain.<br>Perhaps it was simply a cat named \"Ujola,\" or it once belonged to someone by that name. Records from the Akademiya show that this name once belonged to a student from Nod-Krai many years ago. The truth is probably simple â€” after all, it's just a name paired with a cat. What more profound meaning could there possibly be?",
