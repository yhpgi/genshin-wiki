From these memories that since time immemorial have flowed below the land, it has managed to extract the remnant will of a primordial elemental dragon sovereign, drawing it out like marrow to repurpose as the foundation of its own fabricated image.</p><p>But is it truly a mere \"image\"? Brought back by the very otherworldly forces it had once resisted, a once-dead dragon opens its eyes anew, forsaking all in this brief dream of a resurrection. Trapped perpetually in the final day of its existence by this pitch-black gospel, its boundless fury has consumed all reason. Now, what remains is its unrelenting lust for battle, burning on without end.</p>",
