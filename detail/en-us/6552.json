As the power of the Night Kingdom and the Nightsouls grew, so too did the types of objects that could be used for spiritual fusion.

So-called \"freedom\" was an article of faith for the strong alone.\n—But if that be so, then let all chains be broken, all shackles that hold the weak back from flight be shot from the sky.\nIn the beginning, it was only a few orphans who had nowhere to go who stayed by her side,\nAnd then, the wandering warriors, unwilling to be bound by the rules of the tribe, who chose to follow her song,\nAnd then, those dragons who had been banished also came to the forest, seeking her protection.\nThe uncrowned princess accepted them all, human or dragon, whether they had been foe or friend before:\nWith but a single staff she defeated a bandit massive as a mountain who would waylay passersby, and then all former enmity forgotten with a hearty laugh,\nThe evil arrogant dragon was shot down three times and cured three times, and they became fast friends.\nThis was the founding moment of the tribe that would be known as the \"Flower-Feather Clan\" for the next thousand years,\nWhere even those who were weak, feeble, and homeless would no need fear the wind and open sky.\n\"O Outlander hailed as a hero, you seem to misunderstand. I am not their King, and they have no need to submit to anyone\"\n\"None can rule here, for everyone is a crownless king. Let go of those overwrought, convoluted, needless formalities, for the only thing that can please us is the sound of song\"\n\"However, if you are as sincere as your words, if you truly desire to whip up a blazing wind to burn away the eternal shackles\"\n\"If you truly wish to bestow the weak with a place where they are equal, then, O Outlander, whom they acclaim as a hero, I shall journey with you.\""

Old friend, you need only take care of little old me. Why the need to dispatch hundreds of men?\"\n\"Still, as it was I who misjudged my own blood... Then allow me to repay the blood-debt with blood.\"\nThe bowstring was severed, blood drained dry, and even the ever-carried dagger was wielded till it was cloven in two,\nAnd so the hero who had shot countless dragons out of the sky was forced to the end of her rope.\nBut even so, the First Speaker for the Flower-Feather Clan stood straight and tall amidst the overflowing crimson river.\nThe very first arrow, she gifted to her treacherous heir, and the remaining arrows to the usurper's minions,\nThough her bones had long since shattered, then she would use her final arrow to nail her shattered body to the jade bow.\nAnd the end of that road, not even death could force the proud daughter of the dragons to bend the knee.\n\"My honored mother...
