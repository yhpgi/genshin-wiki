Each time she let her vigilance wane, this power would run rampant, eating away at her body: first her fingers, then her palms and forearms, like burned charcoal. The girl had a foreboding that if one day the dark shadow were to creep up her shoulder, and snake from shoulder to heart, she would likely undergo some sort of \"change.\" In her dreams, Peruere saw a wild wasteland illuminated by a crimson moon."

Many children died in such battles or were maimed, and the last ones were sent to be experimented on by another Fatui Harbinger, Dottore, or sent on the most dangerous missions. But these cruel experiments were carried out far from the eyes of people, so only a few knew the truth about the House of the Hearth. Among all the children, \"Mother\" favored and cared for Peruere the most, preferring her even to her own daughter Clervie, Peruere's best friend. But Peruere, thanks to her cold-blooded nature, always saw through Crucabena’s facade and knew the truth about the orphanage. She was confident that she could kill the other children and become the last one alive, so she did not rebel against \"Mother.\" For years, she watched as Clervie tried to tell the others the truth or escape, but each time her attempts ended in brutal beatings. After ten years of Clervie’s fruitless attempts, Peruere came up with another plan: if escape was impossible, she could eliminate \"Mother\" herself, who sat on a throne of lies. Clervie rejected this plan because she still considered Crucabena her mother and feared that the Harbinger possessed unimaginable power and could not be defeated. She could not escape or rebel against her mother, so she chose to die in a duel with her best friend."

Thus, she saved the magician’s assistant, Lynette, from slavery by killing all the family members of the man who bought her and helped the diver, Freminet, find the truth about his dead mother and get revenge on the criminals. The Harbinger allows her children to express themselves: wear jewelry or cut their bangs. As long as this does not threaten the operations, she does not object. One time, on the Hotel Bouffes d'ete's Founding Day, the magician and member of the House of the Hearth, Lyney, secretly prepared a grand magic trick for the other children. A huge magic box was placed in the center of the room, and when the lights began to shine, Lyney said that the most important gift in their lives would now appear before them. The crowd cheered, but it was not a gift that appeared before them, but \"Father.\" Everyone fell silent in amazement, but Arlecchino did not snap at anyone, opining merely that Lyney had kept this secret perfectly, just as a magic show should, declaring it worthy of praise. That night, the children and their \"Father\" delighted in the various desserts together, and she personally sliced a serving of cake for each of them, which she herself enjoyed some of as well. That day, \"Father\" laid down her heavy burden and enjoyed a brief moment of familial love.\nUnlike \"Mother,\" \"Father\" gives the children the freedom to choose their own fate. Although the House of the Hearth has strict laws and betrayal is punishable by \"death,\" this is not real death, but the destruction of the personality and all memories associated with the House of the Hearth, using special bottled flames extracted from the Harbinger. Arlecchino made an agreement with the Iudex of Fontaine that the children's memories would be cleared of all the secrets of the Fatui, and they would be able to live an ordinary, inconspicuous life in Fontaine without being prosecuted for their past.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The Harbinger served the Tsaritsa and knew what a true Archon looked like, so she suspected that Furina, the Hydro Archon of Fontaine, was not the true Archon. To confirm that Furina did not have the Gnosis, The Knave attacked her at night. A second before the attack, the Harbinger saw real fear in Furina's eyes, confirming her suspicions. In order to find out the truth about the location of the Hydro Gnosis, she sent the children of the House of the Hearth to the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, a special device that delivered verdicts in court hearings. During the countdown, Lyney went down into the tunnel and went to explore the room in which the Oratrice's core was stored. When he reached the desired room, he heard someone's voice, which recognized Lyney, and tried to talk to him. The magician decided not to take any risks and left the same way he came. Unable to find any information about the Gnosis in the opera house, The Knave decided to use the imprisonment of the Fatui Harbinger, Childe, in the Fortress of Meropide as leverage against Furina and Chief Justice Neuvillette. Under her orders, the Fatui infiltrated the prison, but none of them returned, and Childe disappeared. Arlecchino then sent Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet, and they received information from the Traveler and Paimon about the Fortress's forbidden zone and the secret it hid, but the Gnosis was also not found in there."

One of the afterimages created by the Balemoon Bloodfire was Arlecchino's best childhood friend, Clervie.

When the children failed to bring the afterimage out into the light within the allotted time, the Harbinger banished the traitors who wanted to escape the orphanage by erasing their memories with liquid flame and fought Freminet, Lyney, and Lynette. Although the children were no match for the fourth of the Fatui Harbingers, she spared them. Clervie's punishment was expulsion from the House of the Hearth, and the afterimage finally realized that she could leave the orphanage and came out into the light, disappearing at dawn. Before she disappeared, the Traveler and Paimon managed to tell her about their adventures in Teyvat, and Arlecchino — about her fate and how the children of the House of the Hearth finally gained the freedom to choose their own lives.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Story 3</color>\nOn the Hotel Bouffes d'ete's Founding Day, all the children were abustle, draping festive colors all over the place.\nTo the residents, outside festivals and events were cold and emotionless things, foreign elements in their lives, and only this dwelling could bring them true warmth.\nEveryone worked in concert to execute Lyney's plan. Lynette had purchased large amounts of festive ornaments, and together with the other children, she strung up colored streamers and hung handwritten festive greetings.\nFreminet was ensuring that the magical props would operate properly — Lyney had faith in his craftsmanship, so much so that Freminet was completely entrusted with all the magic props this time.\nLyney himself was the busiest of all — not only did he have to ascertain everyone's progress, but he was also laying the final groundwork for a grand, unique magic trick in secret.\nAnd thus was the banquet successfully held with everyone's support. The children danced to the joyous music playing from the grand hall's phonograph and enjoyed delicious food — this was the birthday of no one in particular, but this was the day they all felt they had gained new lives.\nThe finale, of course, was Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet's Founding Day magic show. The magic box was at the center of the room, and all waited with bated breath.\nTo preserve the secret behind the magic trick, even Lynette and Freminet knew not what was within. But as the room darkened and all eyes turned to Lyney, standing as he was in front of the box, even the highly-experienced magician showed some rare signs of trepidation.\n\"Now, you might consider the following words an exaggeration, but the \"present\" I am about to present to you all is, without doubt, the most important one we have received in our lives.\"\nThe paper firecrackers burst, and the once-empty box suddenly opened by itself. The crowd cheered, amazed — then fell suddenly into stunned silence.\nWhat stood onstage was no present — nay, this was the Hotel's manager, its owner, and their \"Father.\"\nHer image was one of unsmiling dignity, and thus, though she did not come by often, no one dared to horse around whenever she was around.\nSurely, Lyney had gone completely mad to have her make her appearance in such a frivolous way.\nYet, upon seeing the crowd's reaction, \"Father\" did not snap at anyone, opining merely that Lyney had kept this secret perfectly, just as a magic show should, declaring it worthy of praise.\nThat night, the children and their \"Father\" delighted in the various desserts together, and she personally sliced a serving of cake for each of them, which she herself enjoyed some of as well.\nPerhaps the most amazing aspect of Lyney's Founding Day magic show was its ability to have even \"Father\" lay down her heavy burden and enjoy a brief moment of familial love.\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 5</color>\nWhile Hotel Bouffes d'ete's operations in Fontaine work toward a just cause, its methods can often be radical. Only the influence of \"Father\" and her control over the inner workings of the Court of Fontaine prevent any serious incidents from occurring.\nThere was once an official funded by Lyney who served in the Maison Gardiennage. This person provided both intel in support of the Hotel's operations and scrubbed clean the effects of some of the Hotel's clandestine actions.\nThese were actions that came with no small risk, but the official always performed them well, for he believed that the Fontaine of the present day needed someone like \"Father\" who could bypass the many layers of laws and regulations and take direct action.\nLyney once joked to him: \"I'll be there if you ever need help, and if you're in danger, I'll come to rescue you... Well, don't expect too much of that last bit. Just stay on guard, alright?\"\nThe official knew that this was Lyney's way of expressing concern, of course. Yet even words spoken in jest could prove prophetic later, and so they did — this official's deeds were eventually discovered, and on the brink of capture, he used an emergency communication device to send a message to Lyney.\nUpon discovering the device, the Gardes who arrived at the scene mocked the official's naivete, claiming that the signal sent merely informed his compatriots to save themselves — no one would be stupid enough to try to save him.\nThe official's reply was also quite simple — even such an ending would have been fine for him, for he did not believe that his prior cooperation was the wrong decision.\nBut just as the Gardes were about to arrest the official, thick smoke began billowing forth from dispensers pre-planted nearby, and the official caught sight of a brilliant blaze—\nThe next moment, he was in the drink in the Fleuve Cendre, and was rescued by Freminet.\nIt was said that the Gardes spent a great deal of time chasing after the skyborne flame-trail, believing that the criminal must have used some flying machine to flee the scene, only to discover later naught but wood dressed in clothes, affixed to a glider.\nIn truth, Lyney had earlier used this device to draw the Gardes' attention away before getting the official out of his predicament.\nThe official admitted that he had not had high hopes when pressing the device. Magicians were untrustworthy, after all — but still, he had chosen to gamble on that tiny chance.\n\"Haha. Well, it is indeed a gamble to place your trust in others.\"\n\"But don't worry. Magicians might be full of hot air, but we will never betray the expectations of our audience.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Vision</color>\nAfter Lynette gained the favor of the gods, the missions she had to undertake grew more dangerous and difficult.\nOnly Vision-wielders like Lynette could fulfill the most dangerous missions while remaining completely anonymous, and the twins began to operate separately more often as a result.\nLyney found himself unable to adapt to this. Not only had the siblings been together since childhood, but he knew that he was not the only one who felt disturbed by this split.\nHe still desired to be beside her, lending her all the help he could — this was his non-negotiable desire.\nKnowing his desire for power was no longer pure, Lyney concluded that he had become undeserving of divine favor. Yet he still desired a means to bridge the vast gulf in strength between him and his sister, which he did not possess. Unless...\nTo this end, he solemnly sought out \"Father,\" expressing his belief that he needed the mysterious and perilous might of a Delusion to operate alongside his sister.\n\"Father\" was silent for a long while, till at last two slanted crosses pinned him in place with a wrath rarely shown to the children of the Hotel, her gaze seeming to pierce his very soul.\n\"And would Lynette want you to do this?\"\nHer simple yet powerful question cut through the strings that bound his heart, and in a daze, his sister's words once more reverberated in his ears.\n\"No one needs self-satisfied concern.\"\nLyney did not need to ask his sister to know that she would never accept his desire to stay by her side with the use of a Delusion. It was only then that he realized the absurdity of his wish.\n\"Father\" stood up and left, but not before reminding him that this was not the first time he had lacked power, but that he had found an answer before.\nLyney would lock himself in his room, trying to digest the reasoning behind the words \"Father\" had left him with. When he and his sister had been out on the streets, the answer he had found then had been \"magic.\" What, then, would the answer be now?\nLyney found the dossiers for all the missions Lynette had taken up during this period, carefully analyzing the process of each one and modeling his sister's every action.\nWas it really necessary to pass through this dangerous valley to get close to a target?\nWas it really a must to leap into such a swift river to flee the scene?\nNo, this was just the Vision's light covering her.\nThus did Lyney start to make comprehensive plans for his sister's missions, using his understanding of her to design the most suitable routes, make the most practical tools, and choose the best rendezvous points.\nThe trust between them did not change. The look in Lynette's eyes when she left was no longer so strained, and they often embraced heartily and happily when meeting at the rendezvous point.\nThe pure desire to protect one's family would not be moved, gods' favor or no.\nBut even the best laid plans of mice and men may go awry. After conducting dozens of successful missions, the children of the Hotel were caught up in a betrayal, and as a result, Lynette's movements were exposed.\nBefore the siblings was a towering cliff, just like the night when Lynette had gained her Vision — but this time, it was Lyney's turn to reverse their fortunes in a moment of crisis.\nHe opened his emergency paraglider, and grabbing her, threw himself off the edge. But their pursuers followed, raining gunfire down on them.\nLyney twisted this way and that, avoiding many a shot, but still the glider was punctured in several spots. Unable to maintain balance, they began to plummet downward towards the embrace of the ground below.\nStill, Lyney grit his teeth and refused to despair — should fate itself conspire to refute the answer he had come up with to protect his family, he would defy it to the end.\nTheir pursuers began to snicker, knowing that a fall at such speeds would be fatal — only to have a flame light up the skies, pushing the stricken glider toward a fast-flowing river nearby.\nThe power of Pyro changed the direction of their fall, while Anemo defended them from harm — and thus did the twin lights intertwine and spread under the moonlight, fading slowly like the applause that fills the stage during a curtain call.\nLyney did not guess at the meaning of the shining Vision he saw in his hand. The answer was, after all, no longer important."

Would you mind hearing a story? It's about my past.\nBack when our parents first died, Lynette and I were left wandering the streets.\nTo survive, I took to surreptitiously observing an older street performer who did magic. It took me several days to figure out how he pulled off his amazing tricks.\nI took my sister through several streets until we found a crowded corner, and we began to perform magic tricks there.\nTo my surprise, we proved to be pretty popular, and we could at least stop worrying about where our next meal would come from for a time. But, I didn't want my sister to remain a street rat together with me forever.\nBefore long, an aristocrat came to me, and claimed that he wished to take us in after watching my performances.\nThat was how we felt at first, too... As if fate was on our side, and we could say goodbye to those painful days.\nBut I gradually discovered that while we were called \"foster children,\" he was really after my talent for magic tricks...\nHe would constantly take me to all sorts of banquets to garner attention, which he would then use to expand his social circles.\nThat doesn't seem too bad either... Better than roaming the streets, at any rate...\nIt took a while for me to realize just how dark his heart really was.\nAfter one particular performance at a banquet, I discovered that Lynette was not on the same return vehicle as me.\nI waited a long time after we returned home, but she did not come back. I went to that noble's bedroom and asked him about her whereabouts...\nI managed to ferret out the location of the mansion of that so-called \"eminent person,\" and hurried through the night... But by the time I leaped over the walls, avoided the guards, and made my way in...\nAll I saw was the moonlit ground covered in blood... and The Knave, standing there in the darkness.\nThat's right. She had rescued my sister before she could come to any harm, and had even discovered several girls hidden in a basement — all of them orphans.\n\"Father\"... I mean, The Knave, might have seen something in me, and so, she made me an offer...\n\"The House of the Hearth welcomes you, for your interests align with ours. Here, none will ever betray you. Indeed, betrayal shall never be permitted here.\"\nI was hesitant to trust her. I mean, I had just been betrayed by nobles.\nBut she was also quick to destroy the noble who had taken us in at first, giving us back our freedom."

        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Story 2</color>\nFrom a certain point of view, a \"magician's assistant\" is a contradictory sort of work.\nThe cheers and applause are for the magician, the protagonist, and similarly, the flowers and fame are not directed at the protagonist's sidekick.\nYet a brilliant performance cannot exist without an assistant's cooperation.\nAs the one closest to the magician onstage, the assistant knows all the magician's secrets, and in dangerous performances, the assistant's every move means life or death for the magician.\nOnstage, the magician and assistant are like a double-sided mirror. One tends toward the light, absorbing the audience's attention. The other faces the darkness, pulling levers and strings in the rear to complete the trick — each side turns the other in endless permutations.\nIf they are to operate in harmony, the assistant's skills cannot be far behind those of the magician themselves.\nBut with such skill, how could one long be content to live in another's shadow? Thus do many assistants, once their skills are fully developed, strike out on their own — they will not forever remain the pupil.\nWhen Lyney became famous, many notables took notice of Lynette's potential, believing that she could achieve greater stardom still should she become an independent act. Some even asked her to take up the role of a leading actress in their films.\nCat ears on young lady, who was also a magician... Even with those gimmicks alone, there was a fortune to be made!\nAlas, these passionate entreaties fell on deaf ears, and not only would Lynette reject them... She could not even be bothered to come up with reasons for doing so, instead leaving the task of coming up with them to Lyney instead.\nThis was quite the conundrum indeed, for many of those making requests were distinguished members of society. \"Father\" had left clear instructions — they were not to be treated with contempt.\nAnd if his authorship were to be discovered, any further meetings with them might turn awkward.\nSo Lyney had no choice but to write letter after letter of refusal in Lynette's manner of speech, filling each to the margins with polite and earnest words.\nEven one as silver-tongued as Lyney found it exceeding difficult to mimic her laconic manner of speech.\nExhausted in hand and spirit, glancing at his sister lounging on the sofa, Lyney could not help but think — why not try it for real? He could play the assistant, no problem.\n\"...Don't even think about it.\" Even that flicker of thought could not escape Lynette. She stretched, before flipping over to face him. \"I like being your assistant.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Character Story 5</color>\nPeople often believe that Lynette's cat ears are a part of her performance attire, as the same blood flows in her and Lyney's veins, yet he appears no different from ordinary people.\nHowever, Lynette's ears and tail do, in fact, grow on her body — they are real as real can be.\nIt is said that these cat-like features are inherited, but that even as such a bloodline grows thin across generations, instances of \"atavism\" can still occur from time to time.\nWhen she was young, Lynette did not love this particular gift from her ancestors.\nThere would always be some curious kid who would, whether intentionally or inadvertently, point at them and ask her: Why are you different from everyone else? Are you and Lyney not real siblings?\nThe introverted Lynette did not know how to reply, nor could Lyney always be with her. Whenever such things would happen, she could only push her ears down, curl her tail up, and squat in a corner, by herself and beside herself with misery.\nOnly alley cats would come to comfort her, coiling around and rubbing against her ankles.\nShe could not let her brother see her like this, she knew. He already had a great many things to worry about — he did not need this kind of trivial matter on his mind as well.\nBut she could not simply pretend that nothing was wrong — to deceive the genius magician, she had to fool herself first.\nSo she hugged the cat tightly to herself, softly brushing the fur on its back. As she felt its light breath, calm slowly returned to her heart.\nBy the time the cat leapt from her arms, her face had regained its usual placid appearance.\nAmong Fontaine's nobility, there are also some novelty-seeking degenerates. During one party, a certain \"important person\" found themselves taken with Lynette's unusual appearance.\nOver her protests, despite her struggling, the siblings' foster father stuffed her into that person's carriage without a second thought, almost as if giving away a sofa-scratching cat.\nWhy her? Why was she born with these ears?\nIn her suffocating solitude, Lynette once again covered her ears in pain, unable to hold back the bitterness repressed over long years.\n\"Stop hiding. Cowering will get you nowhere.\" That voice shone through the darkness with the moonlight. \"Come out. The one who wished to harm you is dead.\"\nThat voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call \"Father.\"\n\"You have good ears. Learn to use them.\"\n\"Father\" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light.\nAnd like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness.\n...\n\"When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood...\"\nWhenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby.\nLynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward.\nIt has been a long time since she last folded them back.\n<color=#ffd780>Non-Automated Feeding Machine</color>\nThis is a made-to-order automated feeding machine that Freminet helped construct, intended to deal with the ever-increasing number of small animals at home.\nAfter a certain performance ended, Lynette discovered an abandoned box at the theater's back door.\nAs she opened it, a few kittens, barely a month old, raised their heads in alarm. Yet they had not the strength to flee, and thus could only stare into her eyes anxiously.\nLynette said nothing, nor did she reach out to further startle them. Instead, she simply looked back at them in silence.\nSlowly they seemed to come to the understanding that she meant them no harm, and eventually dipped their straining necks.\nOnly then did Lynette pick the box of cats up, and they laid down in silence, allowing this young lady to take them back to their new \"home.\"\nThere was some small debate amongst family members as to whether the animals should be taken in, but the usually reticent Lynette put her foot down, insisting that they stay.\nThe argument somehow managed to reach the ears of none other than \"Father,\" and she had the final word — which was that her children should cease the silly squabbling.\n\"Those who wish to raise them, do so yourselves — but do it well. Don't make trouble for others.\"\nAfter a short silence, she then added, \"And if you have not taught them how to follow the rules by the end of winter, get rid of them yourselves.\"\nThat statement put paid to the rest of the argument. As for the task of teaching the cats, it fell to Lynette.\nConsidering that Lynette was usually averse to busywork, Freminet had the automated feeding machine custom made.\nThe machine came with an internal clock and a weighing machine that could allow it to feed the kittens various foods at precise times and in fixed amounts.\nThis machine, in turn, became one of the few machines to survive Lynette's tender mercies, never breaking down across many years of service. Indeed, its inner components have remained spanking new, with only the plate beneath the food outlet showing much sign of use.\nAnd this... is because Lynette has never used it properly.\nThe sort of food to add into each box, how to input feeding times and amounts... Rather than memorize that, she found it more convenient to personally prepare the cat food in a plate.\nMoreover, if she had to leave even feeding to a machine...\nLynette squatted next to the Non-Automated Feeding Machine, stroking the satisfied cats' fur in silent thought.\n...How would she be able to teach these children?\n<color=#ffd780>Vision</color>\nWhen Lynette was young, she often heard stories about Visions from Lyney.\nThe protagonists of these tales seemed omnipotent, capable of summoning storms with a flick of a finger, dispelling dark haze with a puff of air.\nThose were not meticulously prepared magic tricks, no — this was the realm of true miracles.\nIf only we had Visions too, Lynette often though.\nThen they could turn magic tricks into real magic. They could pull food to fill their stomachs from hats, and fire to keep themselves warm. Lyney wouldn't have to constantly busy himself keeping them both alive.\nBut the gods never answered her prayers. In later days, she and Lyney would wander on, and after several twists and turns on the city streets and in noble mansions, they found a place to plant their feet under the aegis of their \"Father.\"\nBoth of them knew how hard this chance was to come by, and so they endured the harsh training and supported each other through countless missions.\nReality had eroded their childish innocence all too early, and the dream of possessing a Vision, too, had fallen by the wayside of the past.\nDuring a certain mission, they were dispatched to perform at a noble's mountain villa in order to steal incriminating evidence that their target had hidden in a study.\nThe mission itself was ordinary, and it went quite well. During their performance, the two would tamper with a window in the villa. Once it was over, they would be able to re-enter stealthily and make off with the evidence without a trace.\nBut just as they had succeeded, three flares went up in the forest outside the window — a message from their \"family members\" keeping watch.\nThree flares meant the worst-case scenario: that the Maison Gardiennage was also targeting this person, and indeed had already dispatched forces to the scene.\nIf they retreated the way they came, they had a high chance of encountering Maison personnel, and if they were exposed as having conducted their mission in their guise as magicians, not only would they be doomed, but their \"family members\" would be implicated as well.\nThe voices outside the study were growing louder — if they wished to escape as quickly and stealthily as possible, they would have to take a risk.\nThe villa retreat was built against the mountain, and out the window was a cliff, beneath which was a swift river.\nLynette exchanged a glance with her brother, and without a word, they grasped each others' hands tightly, and leapt out the window.\nThe rippling waves below slammed into Lyney with a terrible crash.\nHe had attempted to absorb the impact with his shoulder just as they impacted, protecting his sister once again, but the impact with the water swallowed his consciousness.\nDesperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.\nFighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut — there was none of his usual vitality to be seen.\nShe hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark, and in that lightless night the twisted trees seemed ever more malevolent.\nShe called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he had in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his fragile and weak breathing.\nThe loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.\nIt had been so long, and they'd been through so much — she'd grown from that, or so she thought.\nWhy, then, were things just like before? Could she do nothing but wait for someone to defend her? As she trembled in the darkness?\nNo. No. It should have been different. They had made so many miracles by their own hand, conquered so many obstacles.\n...She had wished to stand behind him, supporting him, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.\nThe Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their \"family members,\" nor could they stay here.\nThe only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.\nIf she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.\nExtending her ears as high as she could, she listened out for even the slightest wisp of wind.\nAnd the wind sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and they gradually painted for her a blurry scene.\nLynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin and staining her clothes red.\nSlowly, the sight before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to the wind, or her eyes, accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.\nIn this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.\nAs the rays of dawn darted into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their \"family,\" only to encounter someone unexpected — their \"Father\" had personally made the trip down last night.\nUsing the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her in the fall.\n\"Father\" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled.\n\"Sleep now. You've retrieved... a still more valuable prize.\"\nA Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently."

        "text": "<color=#ffd780>Character Story 5</color>\nAfter \"Father\" replaced the previous director, Freminet's thoughts began to turn to finding his mother once again.\nAt first, Freminet assumed that she would rile up a still greater storm of brutality, for he knew that her methods were brutal, and he expected new orders to be given just as pitilessly as they had been in the past. But he soon discovered that \"Father\"'s way of doing things was utterly different.\nWith \"Father,\" the home was a place of refuge for all the family's children, and as such required a collective effort to maintain. It was up to each of them to complete their tasks in the way that best suited them. Even if they failed, they wouldn't be subjected to the searingly painful punishments they had been previously.\nThis taste of freedom finally gave Freminet the chance to breathe deeply, and he started searching for his mother's whereabouts in his free time.\nBut a long time passed and he still wasn't any closer to finding her.\nPerhaps I really was abandoned, Freminet thought, trying to convince himself to accept reality as he strained to summon the already vague memory of his mother's face.\nBut just as he was thinking of giving up, Father threw him a pendant.\n\"I found this at the base of operations of those scum. Keep it.\" said \"Father.\"\nFreminet looked back at her, perplexed, which in turn seemed to confuse her.\n\"What it is? I'm talking about those usurious scoundrels. It belonged to your mother...\" She frowned, suddenly seeming to realize something. \"What were you told about her?\"\nFreminet told her what the previous director had said to him, about how he had been abandoned. As he did so, she said nothing, but her eyes began to burn with wrath.\nAfter Freminet was finished, Father fell silent for a rare moment. \"Do you want to know what really happened?\" She asked, fixing him with a piercing stare.\nFreminet nodded almost unconsciously. But once he had heard what she had to say, he wasn't sure which story he'd rather believe.\n\"Father\" told Freminet that his mother hadn't abandoned him, but on the contrary, had acted to protect him...\nThat year, the debt that his family owed finally reached the point where they would no longer be able to repay it. Those greedy moneylenders had not only forced Freminet's mother to hand over the house that they lived in, but had also demanded that she hand over Freminet as well. But she was his mother — how could she let this happen? In the end, she had no choice but to entrust Freminet to \"that orphanage\" — somewhere they could never get at him — and then face them alone.\n\"This was all I found. As for your mother...\" As she looked at the young boy in front of her, still gripping the pendant tightly in his hands, \"Father\" trailed off and left the ensuing silence to speak for her.\nFreminet's head hung low, but knowing his personality, Father slipped out of the room without another word. The boy was left standing there, shaking as he gazed down at the pendant in his hands. It had long since rusted and could no longer produce sounds, and the clockwork components seemed to have been stained dark brown by dried blood. She must have been holding it at the very end, he thought. In his despair, Freminet continued to stare at the pendant, desperately looking for even a thread of his mother's warmth.\nThat evening, Freminet dived down to the bottom of the ocean and let it all out. He couldn't remember the last time he had cried like this. Other than the Romaritime Flowers that wept alongside him, not a soul heard the sound of his sobbing, for the ocean smothered it utterly.\nFrom that day on, his grip on his greatsword tightened. He made an oath to himself that he would never again let another member of his family meet with misfortune."
