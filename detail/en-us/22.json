So they were more curious than surprised when an outlander began serving as a sailor on their flagship, the Alcor.\nThe sailor in question was picked up when the Alcor docked at the Inazuman port of Ritou.\nBeidou had made friends with this young man, and when he came on board, she told her crew, \"This guy's gonna be staying with us for a while. Take care of him, now.\"\nThe sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.\nStill, their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences.\n\"I've heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?\"\n\"...\"\nKazuha would remain silent in the face of all such queries.\nOver time, after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.\nEventually, it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply.\n\"Hey, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?\"\nThe young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands.\n\"My name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai. I am in your debt for taking me in, so just call me 'Kazuha.'\""

He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.\nInazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.\nAs the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.\nHe had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.\nTo Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.\nWhen the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.\nThese are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway — so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?\nThus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind."

For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.\nAfter leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.\nAll that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.\nIt was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.\nThe traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: \"Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!\"\nBut Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: \"If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away.\"\nBut the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.\nUpon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.\nPerhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.\nWhen he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha stood nearby, looking down at him and smiling.\nBefore the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.\nKazuha smiled and said: \"The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care.\""

One of them was particularly close to his heart, and for a time, the two journeyed together.\nBut they too would part, for their destinations were different.\nTo have met merely by chance and then form such a strong bond, there must be a fated connection between them... so, although they would part ways for now, surely they would meet again. Or so Kazuha thought.\nBut something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition — the Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.\nAll who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.\nIt was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a \"duel before the throne,\" and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.\nThe defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.\nAnd yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.\nEven the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.\nHis friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.\nFrom that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.\nKazuha did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.\nHe did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think...\n\"Is this endless conflict truly the only way to assert one's ideals?\""

Whatever the helmsman, Sea Drake, needed help with clearly couldn't wait."

It was almost as if his late friend were lending him his aid from behind the scenes.\nThis empty shell of a Vision not only proved this, but had also brought him many fateful encounters along the way:\nHe had been aided by the resistance, saved and taken in by Captain Beidou, and he had even met the fabled Traveler...\nIn life there were seasons of hopelessness and desperation, but there were also moments of great serendipity.\nHis journey was like the rise and fall of a mountain path — at times, the struggle was all but too much to bear, but there would always be moments when he would touch the clouds."

            "text": "<color=#ffd780>Unlocks at Friendship Lv. 6</color>\nThe morning mist covered the mountains like a blanket as Kazuha trod a small trail alone.\nThe world was silent. Not a single feather flapped, and not a single cicada sang.\nEven the roiling waves seemed to have fallen into slumber, leaving just the faint whisper of the wind audible against the silence. Kazuha stuck out his tongue — the air tasted heavy and gloomy.\nThis told him that it would soon rain.\nHe peered into the distance and spotted a plume of smoke up ahead. Below it were several straw huts. Tonight, it seemed, he would have a roof over his head.\nHe informed the owner of the house that a storm was coming. At first, he was met with skepticism, but come noon the rains arrived right on cue.\nIn awe of this wanderer's skill, the master of the house eagerly offered him lodging.\nThe storm raged into the night. Kazuha held his quilt close, and as he listened to the onslaught of rain against the autumn leaves, his mind began to wander.\nIn the time since the Kaedehara Clan's fortune had faded away and he had set off on his journey, Kazuha had traveled across many of Inazuma's islands and had become intimately acquainted with the plight of the wanderer.\nMoving between islands usually necessitated traveling by sea. Kazuha would make these trips alone, in a small, slow boat, making things all the more perilous when he had to battle against strong headwinds or violent thunderstorms...\nAnd yet, there was limitless fascination to be found in this same journey of his, where the vast sky and boundless earth was his home, and all living things that inhabited them were his friends.\nIf one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.\nBut if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.\nWith his sword in his hand and his chosen path in his heart, he could go on his way with a song on his lips and with nothing to fear, no matter the perils he may face.\nKazuha slept soundly that night, his mind at rest having made peace with his feelings.\nThe next day, he awoke to the sound of birds... and a shining Vision lying upon his chest."
