Who made them, and who carries them now? Some claimed that it bears the form of a zither from a bygone and ancient nation, yet the symbol seemed to be related to descriptions of dangerous situations. Ultimately, it was confirmed to be the shape of a promontory, symbolic of ill omens on the horizon.</p>",
