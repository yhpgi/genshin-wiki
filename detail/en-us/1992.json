The Wolf followed his scent into battle.\nStill one were they, the Wolf and the Knight.\nThough one they were, death comes for beasts sooner than men.\nLaying down his sword as a gravestone, the Knight of Boreas buried the Wolf in the remote countryside.\nThe Knight of Boreas then left the city behind, living instead the wandering life of a lone wolf.\nYet the eternal wolf spirit remained here,\nWatching over the land the Knight once protected."
