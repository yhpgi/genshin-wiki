In another story popular in Nasha Town, the legendary thief, Reed Miller, was surrounded when a runestone given to him by a holy lady of the Frost Moon as a token of her love allowed him to conceal himself and escape his pursuers. Naturally, the Frostmoon Scions vehemently reject this claim, as these pebbles do not display any such magical properties.",
