But even so, it remains simply a toy duck that can punch its opponents very, very hard. A creator's preferences will always do much to determine a creation's appearance, as clay lacks the authority to question its creator's choice of molds. The world beneath the moon has long been sculpted into a form that people take for granted, but in the eyes of its original inhabitants, that form must surely be like a peculiar duck, shaped by its creator's bizarre predilections.<br>Of course, the blue-haired maid would never say any such thing to the mistress of the Krumkake Craftshop — after all, ducks are adorable, especially compared to the world's present aspect.",

The power to reproduce is the key that separates mankind from the divine.<br>However, if a machine is given an exact mold that it can use to replicate itself, mold included, then can not this too be considered perpetual self-replication? The former master of the silent, blue-haired maid who stands by Aino's side once pondered that same question but ultimately dismissed it out of fear that a perpetually self-replicating machine would consume everything on the planet's surface.<br>Such problems have never concerned Aino. This machine will not exhaust the world's resources to multiply itself just yet — after all, it's just a duck.",
