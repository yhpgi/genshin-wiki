This effect only works in Liyue.<br/><br/>A long rod that stands like elegant bamboo. It is said to have been constructed and kept by a skilled hermit from Liyue, and it was first discovered on a stone tablet with the following words carved upon it: \"O you who aspire, take up this rod,\" like a legendary sword waiting for a hero to pull it out. Of course, you only ever hear this glorious origin story from the mouths of merchants, so it may just be some rhetoric used to increase the item's value... But those who know this and still use this rod can only be those who are ready and willing to accept this pact.",

This effect only works in Mondstadt.<br/><br/>A long, bright, transparent rod created by a poet from Mondstadt. To help borrow the power of Anemo to help raise the rod, the poet rather ingeniously designed a fishing reel made from the leaves of Windwheel Asters, which also imparts a certain romanticism of \"lingering in the wind\" to this device. But perhaps there were issues in the handiwork or in the design itself, for the finalized product could not spin as freely as expected. Perhaps this is what they call \"the chasm between professions?\"",

The ruby-red gem at the tip of the rod represents the tinder used by the cormorant fishers, and the bird ornaments along the rod's shaft represent the cormorants themselves, who helped the hard-working Inazumans pass through those cataclysmic years. This low-efficiency fishing method has long become obsolete, but the persevering, pioneering spirit has been passed down together with this rod.",
