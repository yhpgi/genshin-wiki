Chizuru wanted to go to more festivals, become friends with humans, and play Akitsu Yuugei (the modernized version of Akitsu Haneasobi) with them, but every evening as night began to set in, she'd recall the bitter smile of the old samurai as he set down the hagoita, and the lonely Kamai sighing as he drank his sake. She would wonder if she became friends with a human, would that person experience the same melancholy in the future?

During this test, participants had to find a specific object by following clues. Near the test on the coast, the game Akitsu Yuugei appeared, which awakened Hanyuuda Chizuru.\nChizuru decided to scare people away from the forest so that the little youkai living there would not be able to make friends with people and experience suffering. Since her powers were almost gone, she had to use props to scare people. After meeting the Traveler and Paimon, she agreed to play a round of Akitsu Yuugei with them, with the condition that the loser will have to grant the winner a wish. Having won the round easily, Chizuru wished to never cross paths with the Traveler and Paimon again and disappeared.\nA few days later, during the third round of the Test of Courage, Traveler, Paimon, Heizou, who was investigating the occurrence of the Akitsu Yuugei game kiosk, and the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, Yae Miko, met Chizuru again. They guessed that the hagoita chosen for the search in the third round was Chizuru's true form, which was why she appeared at the festival. Yae Miko told Chizuru that the friendship between a mortal samurai and a youkai did not end with the death of the samurai. The third-generation samurai heir, Tominaga Masanari, also became friends with Kamai, and they later fought side by side during the Cataclysm 500 years ago. The regrets that had been tormenting Kamai over the death of his old friend finally dissipated.\nHaving dealt with her complex feelings, Hanyuda Chizuru made another wish for the Traveler, since the previous one was not fulfilled:"
