Halfway there, she was already tired and hungry. She stumbled into a cave, and came across a strange shrine.\nSo she sat down by the shrine, and took out two pieces of spicy cornbread.\nShe gobbled down one, but left the other one on the shrine, intending to eat a little later, but then promptly fell asleep.\nWhen she woke up, the other spicy cornbread was gone and a mysterious creature was sitting in front of her, staring.\n\"Was it good?\"\nIt nodded.\n\"More?\" She took out some jerky from her backpack.\nThe mysterious creature nodded once again.\nThis was how Xiangling made a new friend. It seemed to be drawn to Xiangling's cooking, as the creature started following Xiangling around wherever she went.\nXiangling named it \"Guoba,\" after her favorite childhood snack."

Local businessman weighed down by sacks of gold, outlanders garbed in strange attire, shrewd and canny public servants, warm-hearted guards... People from all walks of life with all sorts of personalities mingle, to the extent that no one looks out of place.\nWhen someone new suddenly appears in a city like this, people don't bat an eyelid.\nThis particular newcomer to Liyue Harbor is a woman who goes by the name of Xianyun. Tall and slender, she wears a pair of red-rimmed spectacles and exudes an aura that makes her stand out from the crowd.\nTo the Fontainian merchants who sell their mechanical creations on the streets of Liyue, she's already a familiar figure. When passing by, she invariably stops to discuss mechanical design with them — and once such discussions get started, entire afternoons fly by before anyone notices. She seems well acquainted with Chef Mao and Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant as well, and is often to be seen sitting at a table opposite Guoba, waiting for a bowl of piping hot Dragon Beard Noodles. And she's also made an impression on the waiters of both Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion, where she sometimes dines as the guest of Mr. Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Granny Shan, the toy seller, remembers her too. If memory serves, she'd tell you, Xianyun's the one who often brings along a young woman with long, white hair to look at her kites and other trinkets. The young woman, whose name she now recalls is Shenhe, never seems to find anything that takes her fancy — yet Xianyun always brings her back nonetheless.\nJust like many other residents of Liyue Harbor, it seems that Xianyun not only has hobbies of her own, but also travels widely and has many friends.\nSo when people see her chatting with Madame Ping by the fish pond nearby Yujing Terrace, they think nothing of it.\n\"I haven't seen much of Mountain Shaper lately. And Moon Carver still hasn't returned that Multi-Purpose Abode Cleaning Talisman I lent him, to this day...\"\n\"Is that so? What might that be then, some sort of new sigil contraption you've come up with?\"\n\"Yes, let me tell you all about it...\"\nEach day, there comes a time when the lights of thousands of homes finally go out, and Liyue Harbor falls silent for a brief while. With nothing more to see before morning, Xianyun takes this opportunity to take a stroll along the narrow path that winds up Mt. Tianheng.\nJagged outcrops pose little obstacle for Xianyun. With a quick jump up and a gust of wind below, she's already at the top in the blink of an eye.\nGazing down upon the murky streets far below, the human known as Xianyun transforms into a crane, and with a flap of her wings lifts herself up toward the firmament.\nBut of course, there's really nothing strange about any of this. Liyue Harbor is a city that embraces all — so it's only natural that some adepti would end up living here too."

Marchosius was once the Patron God of the Soil, all the wisdom and power he had, he has since surrendered to the soil itself to prevent the kinds of trials and tribulations that a land can face such as droughts, floods, torrential rain, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, and plagues. He once walked over the barren plains with people until arriving at last at the harbor. He joined humans in building their dwellings and lighting the stoves. It was his hand that lit the very first street lamp of Liyue and brought the aroma of cooked food into every household in the land."
