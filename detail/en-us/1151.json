            "text": "Vol. 10\nA long time ago, there was a witch who gave birth to twin daughters.\nHowever, witches are unable to keep two offspring from the same generation. That is the price they pay, the cost of their enormous power.\nBut this witch had already reached the apex of mastery in dark magic. She offered her own life force to preserve the life of her twins.\nStill, this solution could not last forever, and as the last of the witch's life force faded, the day of their fated farewell arrived at last.\nIn death, the witch was finally freed from the world. The surviving elder sister, Nottfriga, inherited everything, and felt entirely responsible for the passing of her younger sister, Magdalene.\nLuckily for Nottfriga, she inherited the witch's talent for dark magic. Using herself as a vessel, she summoned Magdalene's soul using complicated magical symbols and obscure incantations.\nThen, she read all of the leather-bound books in the tower, and combining what she learned with dark magic and alchemy, created a new vessel. However, the ability to place her sister's soul inside the vessel and bring her back to life was not only a forbidden art in light magic, it was also exceptionally difficult — especially for Nottfriga, who knew no light magic whatsoever.\nNevertheless, Nottfriga's insistence on bringing Magdalene back spurred her on, and eventually she found a solution. She transformed the vessel into a serpent bracelet that she wore on her wrist, and set out on an adventure.\n\"My beloved sister, when this is all over, we will never be apart again...\""
