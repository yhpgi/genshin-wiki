Fearing the ire of the gods and the adepti,\nThe Geovishaps, who once heeded the trembling of the rock and wrought havoc alongside the dragon,\nFled into the roots of the mountains.\nBut as millennia passed, the dragon began to stir once again...\nThe legends hold that those who triumphed over the dragon stabbed this sword into the ground next to the giant tree that subdued the ancient dragon.\nAs one of the seals, monsters and malevolent mortals would be unable to touch it.\nIndeed, if the legends are true, only those with hearts as pure as clear mirrors could even come near it.\nYet, if those legends are true, how did this sword come to be lost?"
