  "desc": "<p>A new fishing aid developed by Delaroche that applies the principles of odor analysis and advanced bait mimicry. It is said that its effect is \"very powerful.\" You can tell by the appearance that Delaroche thinks the world of this bait, with protective wrapping and a special bag. However, it is unknown whether such meticulous measures will affect the basic function of the bait â€” even if it attracts fish, the fish themselves may be unable to even find a way to bite down upon it.</p>",
