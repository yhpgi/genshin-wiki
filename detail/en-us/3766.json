The information regarding the Khvarena are, in turn, annotations I made based on a mix of on-site examinations and logical deductions...\nThese Khvarena life-forms were able to delve into underground locations where few humans might be found. Assuming that there is no heretofore-unknown greater power pulling their strings, we can deduce that they too, at some point, had some will of their own...\nAlthough research into Khvarena has only just begun, I believe that the reliance of this power on a specific ecology means that we need not expend too much time looking into it..."
