Their consciousness may diminish, but their power and hatred will always remain and spread like poison, relentlessly stirring up chaos for the world and its inhabitants. The gods who returned to the cycle of elements did not give up but returned in the form of demons. Tormented by anger, they gave rise to a miasma, which in turn engendered all manner of plagues, monsters, and other perverse evils. They starved the earth and churned the waters, and wrought devastation on the people. To purge the demons, Rex Lapis summoned the Yakshas. The Yakshas, fierce and warlike, illuminated beasts of Liyue, were ready to do anything to protect the lands. In battle with demons, they wore masks that terrified the demons, hiding the part of themselves that made them human. The Yakshas swore to restore order and deal with evil: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Restore order through slaughter, purge evil through battle. To this, we dedicate our lives.\"</color> Five of the many were the strongest: Marshal Vritras Bosacius, General Musatas Indarias, General Chizapus Bonanus, General Kapisas Menogias, and the Golden-Winged King Alatus. Together with the Archon, they banished plagues, defeated demons, and became known unto mortals as \"The Yakshas.\" They knew that the war they fight can never be won, and would never come to an end. It is also an invisible war that no one will ever witness or thank them for."

The terrible deeds committed over long millennia began to eat away at the Golden-Winged King from within. He lost his kin, friends, and allies, faced the impossibility of redemption, burnt in everlasting anger, and knew no respite. He turned against his past grievances but received neither retribution nor relief, and his reward was only an emptiness in his heart that eternity could not fill. One day most of Xiao's strength was spent fighting from dusk till dawn, with him emerging victorious by a mere hair. Long exhausted, Conqueror of Demons felt the divine hatred that tainted his body take effect. Limitless hate flooded his senses, and he fell to the ground in agony. But it was also at that moment that the pain vanished without warning. This was not by Xiao's own strength, for he had been rescued by the sound of a flute of the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. The clear, lovely sound of the flute came over the mountains and rivers, carried on the wind to where he lay. It protected Alatus, massaging his wild senses, and giving him a moment's peace. And although the Conqueror of Demons was alone his entire life, there were still people in the world ready to protect him.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

The Chasm, where ancient evil had long been hiding, became the center of battles with the monsters of the Abyss. The Milleliths were tasked with evacuating the locals and miners, and some soldiers remained at the Chasm to cover the retreat. The four-armed Yaksha, Bosacius, came to their aid. With a sword in his hands, he entered the Chasm to put an end to the suffering of people. Purple bale-fire shone in his eyes, and people said that the Yaksha defended the Chasm not to fulfill the order of Rex Lapis, but to atone for eternal sins, to gain forgiveness for the cowardice and weakness he once showed. Be that as it may, the Yaksha descended into the mines with the Milleliths. In the course of fighting side-by-side with the Yaksha, these mortal soldiers could not escape being contaminated by karma, or harmed during the slaughtering. To avoid being consumed by the darkness of constant killing, the Millelith soldiers used a timepiece to silently mark the passage of time during each battle. They fixed a unified marching pace and schedule so that one squadron of mortal soldiers would take the battlefield as the one before they retreated. This cycle of advance and retreat continued all the way to the depths of the Chasm, where the Yaksha and valiant soldiers both fell."

It used the weaknesses and fears of people and showed them illusions to lure them into a trap. Because of karma, the Yaksha forgot himself, his brothers and sisters, and why he came to the Chasm. At the cost of their lives, Boyan and Bosacius were able to seal the subspace with the Fantastic Compass — an artifact capable of changing space and sealing monsters. Before dying, the four-armed Yaksha's mind cleared, and he remembered his friends. Bosacius remained trapped in the Chasm, and Alatus later encountered his phantom manifestation in this subspace when he arrived in the mines to search for his missing brother. To escape the subspace and save the people, Xiao was ready to sacrifice himself but he was saved by Rex Lapis.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

To comfort the Yakshas, they were offered food and sung holy chants. All this would appease the Yaksha and give them strength to continue defending the peace. Today, huge statues of the Yakshas defeating evil spirits still stand in Liyue, but their faces have long since deteriorated beyond recognition. In the mortal world, almost nothing is known about the Yakshas, because they are not popular deities that bring wealth and protection, and not mystical sages to whom pilgrims flock in search of divine wisdom. No one would think of thanking Xiao, for they would be terrified of his divine power. The sight of Xiao, even far off in the distance, was intimidating enough to send people instantly running for their lives. However, the Qixing, which governs Liyue, assigned one of their secret agents to support the Conqueror of Demons in subduing demons. That secret agent runs a front organization called the Wangshu Inn. Occasionally, Xiao stops by the inn for a bowl of Almond Tofu, which reminds him of the dreams he used to devour."

He gave people medicine, accompanied merchants, and helped the brokenhearted in exchange for donations. Using the Sigil of Permission, he drove away demons but did not kill them, so they gradually gathered in one place, threatening people with danger. After learning about the fraud, the Conqueror of Demons used an Adeptal art named Dream Trawler to summon the soul of Starsnatcher. The ritual consists of four parts: offering incense, meditation, incantation, and loosing an arrow. To offer incense, one needs to place the incense into the censer with reverence for Rex Lapis in their hearts. Meditation is to empty people of trivial thoughts and to focus on the target of the art we are performing. Then, people shall recite the incantation in a loud voice: <color=#ffffffd9>\"Devayaksha, Bring Forth Sin!\"</color> , and finally — loose an arrow toward each of the Yaksha statues to enlist their authority for the contract. When the soul of the false Adeptus was summoned, he swore to Alatus to renounce evil, live according to his conscience, and not defame the name of the Adepti."
