You may have it, my dear, just as you have claimed the mantle of that master thief...\"\n\"But do remember: I was the first to break this mechanism.

The thief, who went by the \"Escape Artist,\" had left a taunting message on the wall, and its sting left her seething with fury — as well as humiliation.\nWhat followed were countless grudging contests, each one ending in a humbling defeat.\nThe lockpicking skills the young woman once prided herself were found constantly wanting in her rivalry with this unseen nemesis.\nThe more she failed, the more her shame burned, and the more she hungered to meet the one who kept beating her.\nThis went on until one day, the infuriating rival who always left her red with rage vanished without a trace.\nSubsequently, word reached her that this thief had been caught and executed.\nFor reasons she could not explain, she found herself at the rambling graves, unearthing the stone coffin containing the prisoner's body.\nBut when she dug it up and looked inside, she found that the body was gone. All that remained was a mocking sentence, etched in the cold stone.\nWiping away tears she couldn't quite explain, the young woman cursed her longtime foe's cunning through clenched teeth.\nAs always, she swore to dedicate her life to uncovering the truth behind his faked death and, once and for all, outwitting him.\nIn the end, time claimed both the beauty she once flaunted and the final breath she held.\nBereft of the strength to pick even a simple lock, the woman cursed his name one last time before resting inside the empty coffin."
