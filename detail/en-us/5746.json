They lost their homes and loved ones, the disaster brought unbearable pain, but they could not even escape this torment. The pure-blooded, declared \"greater sinners\" by the Heavenly Principles, were doomed to the endless torment of the flesh, doomed to watch everything they loved perish, while the rest were transformed into monsters by the curse of the wilderness. Chlothar Alberich was one of the purebloods, a nobleman from the royal court of Khaenri'ah, but he resented the life that his family had arranged for him. One day, he met a beautiful woman amongst the people, and her Mondstadt roots did not matter to him as it was love at first sight. They had an illegitimate son named Caribert. Due to his heritage, Chlothar could not be with his son, and the boy faced great hardship from the very moment of his birth, all due to his father's selfish desires. Alberich was never able to be with his son. When all the Khaenri'ahns were cursed, Chlothar was doomed with immortality, and Caribert turned into a hilichurl before his eyes and fell into a coma."

Chlothar attempted to make a Nameless Taboo Medicine of the Royal Court, which, according to legend, was imbued with the power of the God of Wisdom and was able to awaken the addled mind. He learned of this medicine from a book in the Royal Library of Khaenri'ah, which was forbidden because the medicine required the power of the Archons. In his youth, Chlothar disliked the life of nobility and craved excitement, and while leafing through some forbidden texts, he stumbled upon this book. While Alberich was living in Sumeru, he met the Princess/Prince of Khaenri'ah, who had accidentally ended up there while traveling with another cursed Khaenri'ahn, Dainsleif. Chlothar immediately recognized the Princess/Prince, but did not want to reveal his identity and introduced himself as one of his former servants, Eide. Once, the Khaenri'ahns saw the Abyss in the Princess/Prince, a wondrous mystery far beyond their imagination and comprehension. They believed that she/he would take them to control everything. Since the man was unable to prepare a cure without help due to erosion, he asked the Princess/Prince to help him. The key ingredient in the cure was a special mushroom grown in the field where Caribert's mother was buried. The final step in preparing the cure was to obtain the power of the God of Wisdom, and Chlothar went to the Statue of The Seven."

Inside the ruins of the ancient civilization, where the hilichurl descended, there were many other hilichurls, who seemed to be bowing down to something. Before the last hall, they were met by the Fortune Lector, who prepared a test of destiny for them in order to gain some kind of audience. To Chlothar, this creature seemed to have a truly enchanting power, deadly and beautiful at the same time, and so perfect that it inspired awe. In the hall, Chlothar and the Princess/Prince saw a huge purple glowing stone, wrapped in chains and suspended from the ceiling. When Chlothar saw this creature, he was immediately overcome with awe and joy, and he knelt before it. As Alberich left the cave, he thought with horror of kneeling before the Statue of The Seven, but he had a strange feeling that something destined by fate had happened. When Chlothar gave Caribert the second dose of medicine, the boy woke up. Caribert felt like he had woken up from a long dream, where he was hiding in a small room and could not bring himself to leave it. When he woke up, his father told him that they had entered a fairy-tale world where there was no longer a red sky, nor their home, nor Khaenri'ah. And in this world, Caribert became a monster who could not remove his mask, but who would always be by his father's side."

After founding the Abyss Order, Chlothar's faith in it inspired him to do many things, but the curse of immortality endlessly tormented his body and spirit, and the Abyss in which he believed did not save him in the end. Several hundred years later, the Princess/Prince's twin saw what was happening from a first-person perspective through the damaged by the Abyss Ley Lines. When they excavated the field near Chlothar's house, they saw two skeletons were found: one of Caribert's mother and one likely of Chlothar, who had somehow managed to lift his curse.
