Isn't this supposed to be a library?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Seems more like a storeroom at this point.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Are they doing some more renovations?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color> Look, Lauma's over there talking to a Weasel Thief...

Is there anything I can help you with?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: I saw you talking to the Weasel Thief.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Have you found some more buried relics?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> No. I was just giving the little one a bit of a stern warning. It's been getting a little overexcited lately, and it's starting to bother the community.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Its passion for treasure-hunting has only grown since we retrieved the Lunar Semblance... It comes to me all the time, asking when the next treasure hunt will be.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> I keep repeating that we now have more than enough documents and relics in our library to occupy our research, but alas...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: It can't change its nature.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: It went off treasure-hunting on its own?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Yes. But it doesn't quite understand what constitutes a \"relic,\" so it simply digs up anything that seems valuable and drops it off here.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> It has at least promised me that it won't go digging around again, but there's already a big backlog of items from previous digs... There's no way around it. I'll just have to go through and sort them one by one.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Sorry, you two. I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you on your sightseeing today.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Phew... Now then, what's in this box again...?\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Lauma again\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Phew... Now then, what's in this box again...?"

It seems like this one just bagged anything and everything that grabbed its attention.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> The seeds and rocks will be easy enough to deal with, but those storage boxes and wish-boxes will have been buried with the express purpose of digging them up at a later date.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> Will you need any help?\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Thanks for the kind offer, but I've already engaged another, slightly more mature weasel thief to handle this. It will be in charge of moving all the items back to their original spots.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> After all, the kid's heart was in the right place.

It's only natural that I've come to understand them — no different from making friends.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> By contrast, other people can't understand what animals are saying, so they're bound to make mistakes when trying to understand them.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> That's why, in a lot of literature on the topic, phrases like \"bestial nature\" are rife with negative connotations, while \"human nature\" is seen in a more rounded light...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: Well, humans are the ones writing the books...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler: They can't hear the animals' side of the story...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Heh... You're right. I'm sure those books would have turned out quite differently if they were written by a wolf or a rimehorn deer.\n<color=#ffffff>Rimehorn Deer:</color> ...\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> ...In any case, to me, \"human nature\" and \"bestial nature\" are both simply \"nature.\"\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Whether human or beast, all have moments of courage and of cowardice, times of both greed and rage...\n<color=#ffffff>Puffin:</color> ♪\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> We all rejoice in our successes and mourn our failures... These experiences are neither inherently human nor inherently animal. They are a part of our shared nature — a nature bestowed upon all living things by Mother Nature herself.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> I do sometimes wonder whether the world around us might have turned out for the better if humans and animals could communicate with each other.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> But I know it is but a fantastical idea that can never be.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Then there are those who reject nature, and turn their back on the natural way.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> They are the wayward ones who do not hesitate to pull the trigger, even when they speak the same language as the object of their slaughter.\n<color=#ffffff>Rimehorn Deer:</color> ...\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> ...Yes, child. I know you can protect yourself, and that you are far fleeter of foot than they. Do not worry, no one shall harm you again.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> Ah, how time flies. I should get back to sorting through that pile of treasure.\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> I should have enough time to get everything in order before the weasel thief arrives.\nOptional Dialogue: Talk to Lauma again\n<color=#ffffff>Lauma:</color> What do we have here...?
