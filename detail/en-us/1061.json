To the Anemo Archon!\nTo Vennessa, the first Knight to grace this world!\nSons and daughters of Mondstadt, may the gift from the Anemo Archon be engraved in your hearts!\nAnd let it be known that this gift is not freedom, but just defiance!\nIt transpired in ages past.\nFriends, do excuse me for improvising,\nFor it should be clear as day, that the glory and freedom of Mondstadt\nWere born when Barbatos struck the strings dolce.\nPoems sing of heroic fame,\nYet to commemorate unnamed freedom should they aim.\nChained by the royals, Mondstadt could barely suspire,\nAnd festivities were but vanity games of the rich,\nBeyond the grasp of the ordinary people.\nA withering dungeon, Mondstadt was.\nIn slavery games the royals gaily relished,\nOblivious to their place, the inmates were.\nA fiery-headed dame confined to a cell,\nFrom the southern plains she did hail.\nBorn free but now bound by chains,\nThough restrained by a tyrant her flesh remained.\nStill her pious soul never ceased to pray,\nFor her people, for Mondstadt, for illusive freedom if she may."
