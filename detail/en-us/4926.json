When Elynas emerged in Fontaine 500 years ago during the Cataclysm, he realized that his existence was causing harm to everything around him, so he decided to die. Although his consciousness continued to exist, his body decomposed, and his heart petrified. More than 400 years ago, a battle took place inside his body between agents of the Marechaussee Hunters, the special investigative branch of the Maison Gardiennage of the Court of Fontaine, and members of the forbidden organization the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. From the wounds Elynas received during this battle, the Melusines were born — the beautiful daughters of Elynas. Each Melusine was born next to the shard left behind during the battle, and they considered it their \"token,\" which they cherish for the rest of their lives."

To protect his daughters, Elynas created the Breacher Primuses, unusual living creatures that are neither plants nor animals. They were less intellectually developed than the Melusines themselves, but some Melusines began to care for them as their pets.\nOver time, almost all Melusines lost the ability to communicate with Elynas and forgot about him. Some consider him a gentle \"mother,\" while others simply do not remember their origin. The only Melusine capable of communicating with the \"Father\" is the artist Mamere. Elynas often gives her advice, but other Melusines consider Mamere strange."

For example, Canotila sees Paimon as a little rainbow balloon floating in the air, and her string seems to extend upward, to somewhere above the sky itself. She also sees the Traveler as a monster that looks like it could swallow the whole world in a single bite. Sluasi sees the sun as \"black.\" Moreover, Melusines can see blood stains even if they are not visible to humans. Melusine aesthetics are very different from human ones. For example, Poissonchant pie looks like a tool to cast some kind of forbidden magic due to the fish heads that stick out from the cake and stare at the eyes, gleaming with a strange light. For Melusines, these heads look like a choir in a picture book, with everyone holding their heads up high and singing happily. The special nutritious dish Sigewinne prepares for the tired inmates of the Fortress of Meropide looks more like a punishment. There is even a \"hidden rule\" among the inmates: people are not supposed to work three days in a row, and if they do, they'll get \"strange meat\" in their welfare meal. Melusines don't view humans based on their appearance, their approach is based on \"cuteness.\" Even people with injuries may look like cute little kitties with slightly scruffy fur for them.\nAll Melusines are female, and Fontaine's Iudex Neuvillette even decreed that they should be addressed by the pronoun \"she.\"\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

For twenty years they lived in the Merusea Village, but some decided to look for the meaning in other places. With the help of Iudex Neuvillette, the Hydro Dragon, who did not feel at home among humans, they ended up in the Court of Fontaine. At first, people were unkind to the Melusines: they considered them creatures of disaster, and dangerous for people, so they threw stones at them and told them to return to their village. Some people were subconsciously wary of the Melusines because they looked different. A group of supporters of the old regime, whose interests were infringed as a result of Neuvillette's reform, decided to commit murder and blame Melusines for it. Melusine Carole, an agent of the Marechaussee Phantom, decided to sacrifice herself in this situation, as she considered it the only way out. Thanks to Carole's courage, over time her dream of living peacefully with people came true: today, 400 years later, the Melusines are respected members of the Court of Fontaine.\nDue to their special vision, Melusines are useful members of the Marechaussee Phantom, which is currently composed almost entirely of Melusines. Some Melusines, such as Aeval and Elphane, work as guides on the Fontaine aquabus line.

Unlike most Melusines, Sigewinne wanted to understand humanity. Her attention was drawn to the magic of the science of \"medicine.\" It was said that this magic was quite marvelous, even able to change the natural law known as death by age and ailment. Sigewinne wished to master this magic, believing that it might help bridge the chasm between Melusines and humans, allowing the former to blend in with the latter. One day, she met a traveling doctor who the children called \"the witch.\" Although the Melusine's thoughts about medicine seemed childish to the doctor, she invited Sigewinne to study. Following the doctor, the Melusine learned to prepare various medicines as well as to scare off children with ghost stories. She would also refer to this \"witch\" as her \"Teacher.\" When they met a patient who could no longer be helped, the teacher asked to give him painkillers.

The Melusine knew she committed a crime so she surrendered herself and was sent to the Fortress of Meropide. After serving her sentence, the Melusine remained there, becoming an important part of the local administrative system. Now Sigewinne is the head nurse of the Fortress, and for patients, she seems like an angel descended from heaven, and the \"sun\" of the fortress, which brings a radiant warmth to their dark, damp prison. To thank the \"angel\" for her kindness and care, the guards added another \"unwritten rule\" to the set of numerous rules of the Fortress of Meropide: any who are rude to Sigewinne are punished extra harshly. The inmates, for their part, also have an unspoken agreement that any particularly wild and violent newcomers must receive a \"warning\" upon being admitted. Sigewinne herself is blissfully unaware of all these customs that have cropped up around her and simply serves her patients as she always has."

Sigewinne believed that she understood humanity better than other Melusines and saw certain fundamental qualities that couldn't be changed with their appearance. She joined an investigation to confirm her suspicions, and because of her insight and help, all the criminals were found.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

He not only brought them to the Court of Fontaine but also helped them to remain in the city and issued a decree on the correct treatment of them. Many people regard this as the understated goodness of his heart having found an outlet in becoming a \"father.\" Neuvillette has always seen himself as a parent to Melusines. The Hydro Dragon regards Melusines as dependents and successors, and also as the finest example of a new sort of Hydro Vishap species. For Neuvillette, Melusines are beautiful creatures, the real pride of Fontaine. They should be befriended and should never be harmed.\nLong ago, when the Melusines had just come up to the surface world, many of them would present gifts to humanity as gestures of goodwill. Yet this was exploited by evil folk, bringing danger upon many Melusines. Thus, it was that Neuvillette gathered them all, strictly prohibiting such behavior.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"
