Later he heard Mother's voice, who wished for Elynas to be born into a beautiful world. She gave him life, a strong and healthy body that could walk the world, and a beautiful name. She wanted to give him many siblings, to meet many friends, and to see the beautiful sights beyond that cosmic dark. Elynas and his siblings loved and cared for each other.\nLater, Elynas along with his siblings left the world beneath the earth. He felt the wind brushing against his skin, the warmth of the sun, waters icy and warm. At first, Elynas was happy, but he soon discovered that what seemed interesting and funny to him was scary and dangerous for others. He learned that his blood was poisoned and that he was bringing suffering and destruction to the people of Teyvat, but it was too late.\nJudging by the fact that Elynas blood is similar in composition to the Shadow Dragon Durin’s blood, that they both referred to the creator as Mother and they both have the same goal when they entered Teyvat, it can be assumed that Elynas and Durin have the same creator — the alchemist Rhinedottir, also known as Gold. She is the mother of Durin, Albedo and many other Abyssal beasts, and also one of the reasons for the Cataclysm.\n<color=#ffd780>Related Entries:</color>"

When most of the fleet's ships were sunk, the Sponsian flagship was significantly damaged, and Elynas himself was wounded, the Sponsian overtook the beast.

It was Jakob Ingold and Rene de Petrichor, who used the flesh and blood of Elynas to research and improve the powers of the first Neohuman Jakob. But one day, many other creatures appeared in his body, including metal machines, a spirit of the primordial waters and other people. There was a battle and an explosion inside Elynas's body that damaged his flesh, and from these wounds the Melusines, Elynas's children, were born. Each Melusine was born with a shard of broken Mek, so they began considering these objects as their \"token,\" which must be protected. To protect himself and his daughters, Elynas created the Breacher Primuses, unusual living creatures that are neither plants nor animals. They were less intellectually developed than the Melusines themselves, but some Melusines began to care for them as their pets."
