  "desc": "A musical instrument that can be used in performances.<br/>It is made of rather unique materials, and its craftsmanship is quite different from the designs that are currently in vogue. An unpredictable strength has been woven into the ethereal strings that can even allow it to cause the illusions within the heart of its player to surface.<br/>There is an old adage in Liyue: \"the longer one's eye of the flower drinks, the deeper one's heart into the mire sinks.\" It seems that only the strong-willed may use this instrument.",
