The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.\n\"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\" Or so most alchemists would protest.\nBut as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.\nAt least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.\nThis young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Akademiya did not possess.\n\"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\"\nAs if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.\nSeconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.\n\"And this... is new life.\""

In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.\nHe is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.\nAs a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.\nOn days when he shuts himself away in his laboratory to focus on his work, or heads out into the wild to gather materials, no one in Mondstadt will be able to find him.\nYet Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.\nHe delights in giving guidance to his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose.\nHe finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.\nYet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian."

But Monstadt's gates are open to everyone, and he would have been quite welcome even without the recommendation letter.\nIn fact, Albedo's life in Mondstadt may even have been more comfortable without it.\nThis is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer, Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir.\nAfter receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests.\n\"So, Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\"\nAnd just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.\nThe work of the Knights was actually quite easy for Albedo, requiring only five percent of his energy.\nThe rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal, he thought.\nAnd yet...\nAlice has a daughter, named Klee.\nYes, \"that\" Klee.\n\"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\"\nFrom that day forth, cleaning up after Klee would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy..."

They are all important people. And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.\nFor Albedo, she is his only kin.\nShe was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy.\n\"The universe is the sable essence of the true starry sky... Earth is the accumulated memory of time and being...\nChalk: that is you. Soil is where alchemy derives its name, and is the basis of all life.

Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.\nBut one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.\nAnd with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.\nUpon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\"\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\nIn the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?\n\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\""

As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.\nThis art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\"\nAlbedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.\nThe next stage after \"soil\" is \"chalk,\" which was also something his master had mentioned.\n\"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\"\nNow, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.\n\"From soil was birthed chalk.\"\nThe profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.\nSuch ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.\nShe was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.\n\"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?\"\nFrom time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment."

But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies.\nAdditionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else.\nEventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition.\nWhen strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy.\nSometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring.\nAlbedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength — until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.\nHow was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?\nAmazed, he decided to give it a go himself.\n...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, \"A Legend of Sword\" was printed and published.\nUnfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as \"a dictionary with divine illustrations.\""

Either way, I'm happy to see her succeed more and more in her endeavors.\n<color=#ffd780>About Sucrose: Habits</color>\nWorking with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research. For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me \"Albedo\" since we are about the same age, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. *sigh* ...Whatever she prefers, I guess.\n<color=#ffd780>About Albedo: Artistry</color>\nAs his assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art.\n<color=#ffd780>About Albedo: Talent</color>\nTalent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research — I'd still spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams — nothing more.\n<color=#ffd780>About Jean</color>\nI don't dare talk to Master Jean that much, because she's so strict. I know she's a good person and all — I know that, I do — but... I still find her scary. I don't tend to bother her, and even when I have to... I ask Albedo to go on my behalf."
