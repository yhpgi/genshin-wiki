By the time the calamity finally waned, the withering tide had permeated her very bones.\nAs the last shadow crumbled with a scream, the aged Fietena removed her mask,\nAnd this prop, with which she had played the \"hero\" for many years, she handed to Taika, a young follower from the Flower-Feather Clan.\n\"It seems this was my final battle... Come now, no need to look so grim.\"\n\"When the storm passes, a rainbow will shine; but remember, its false colors are but illusions in the mist.\"\n\"Whether truly a hero or just acting the part, there will always come a day when it's your turn to bow out.\"\n\"That is the way of the wrestler. But now, Taika, let this mask bear witness to the journey before you.\""
