Its basic components include <color=#ffe14b>\"beam generators\"</color> and <color=#ffe14b>\"beam receivers.\"</color>\nThe beam generator must sometimes be installed on a \"beam receiver\" base similar to a regulating valve, and can be controlled and rotated through the use of energy from a Xenochromatic Ball Octopus."
