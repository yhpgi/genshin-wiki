  "desc": "When used, this useful gadget can save and store the scenery before it and add a special color tone to it.<br/>A strange device from Fontaine that will not only record sceneries but will also add special colors to the printed images. This design was made in response to \"The Steambird\"'s request for a Kamera that could not only reflect the environment, but also the emotions of the one taking the picture. Unfortunately, the final product could not quite match their specifications.",
