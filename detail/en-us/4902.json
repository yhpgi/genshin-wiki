Elemental dragons are rarely seen and have the powers to match the gods of old. The high dragon slowly descended and inspected everything with curious eyes. He landed in a village, but the terrified villagers threw rocks at him. The dragon could not understand why they cried out in fear. He landed in a cemetery and only heard the lament of grieving people. The dragon was perplexed as to the reason for their sorrowful murmurs. He landed in an orchard but was cursed by the furious farmers who lost their trees. The dragon couldn't figure out why they yelled in fury. The world was too complicated for a young dragon. The dragon was bewildered, yet he did not give up. One day, the dragon heard music pouring out from the Holy Lyre der Himmel. This was the name of the lyre belonging to the Anemo Archon. Enchanted by the poetry, the Wind Dragon landed beside the best singer under the skies. People panicked, for the mighty elemental dragons and the great archons that reigned over the earth had never seen eye to eye.\n<color=#ffffffd9>\"Behold his beauty and benignity!\"</color> The Windborne Bard sang.\n<color=#ffffffd9>\"But we do not know him,\"</color> the people replied."

An alchemist named Gold, corrupted by her own greed and ambition, created an army of shadowy monsters with their uncanny powers that filled all seven kingdoms of Teyvat. These were particularly difficult times for Mondstadt. The Lionfang Knight was without a suitable heir, and the Knights of Favonius had lost many of their brave men and women during the bitter wars. The black serpent-dragon Durin was one of the \"children\" of the alchemist Rhinedottir, who rose from the sea, casting his shadow over Mondstadt. The people of Mondstadt believed that he wanted to destroy all living things. The envy of the devilish dragon gave rise to evil that poisoned the land and the people who lived on it. In those terrible days, bloodthirsty monsters and desolation came to Mondstadt."

In a battle that ripped clouds from the skies, Dvalin spread his six blessed wings wide, severing the sky and tearing through Durin's iron scales with the force of a colossal blade. As the conflict plunged the world into darkness, the Wind Dragon struck out with his claws, like swords forged of wind, and they pierced deep into Durin's dark, corrupt flesh. The battle shook the heavens; even the sun quaked with fear. Finally, Dvalin tore out Durin's throat with his teeth, and the evil dragon fell from the sky."
