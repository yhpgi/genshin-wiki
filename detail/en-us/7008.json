Shall we have some ice to cool our heads, then talk about this later?\n<color=#ffffff>Tepetlisaurus:</color>\nShrawrr—!\n<color=#ffffff>You hear a scream at first, followed by the thud of something heavy falling to the ground. Then, all that's left are Saurian cries...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHuh!? Is that person alright?\nUgh, he's surrounded... We can't see what's going on at all...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nShall we try a view from above?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm. Seems like Little One wants to give it a try — go on then, little buddy!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nGrawr...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh, something's not right. Is that person dead— Ugh, no, no, pish posh! Maybe he just passed out. But still, we can't just stand by and do nothing!\nUm, could you three please let us through?\n<color=#ffffff>Tepetlisaurus:</color>\nShrar! Grawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Koholasaurus:</color>\nMmrawr...?\n<color=#ffffff>Yumkasaurus:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nWhoa, they won't let us through at all... What's going on? Considering what that person said before, he might know these Saurians...\nIf only we had more clues...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\n...Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm? Have you discovered something, Little One? Come on, let's keep up!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Description:</color> You encounter someone surrounded by three Saurians out in the wild...\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Find a way to distract the Saurians together with your Saurian companion</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Someone's Diary:</color>\n\"...Today's a rainy day. I prepared \"Ripple\" his favorite Sour Sauce Kipper. His look of satisfaction made it all worthwhile...\"\n\"...Even if he's swimming in a leisurely manner, the moment I proffer some of that Sour Sauce Kipper... Whoosh! Out he pops from the water, and in such lovely form, too...\"\n\"...I would never doubt his affection for me. Only, perhaps, that he might love the kipper more...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSo... Ripple's this Koholasaur's name, huh? Guess the Sour Sauce Kipper in the pot must've been for her.\n<color=#ffffff>Someone's Diary:</color>\n\"...Big round sparkling eyes, curly tail and cheery cries... Jade, oh, Jade, is there a cuter Saurian in this world than you...?\"\n\"...You have never once been cheated, nor never once doubted, as if all life might become your friend and enjoy a wonderful time playing with you...\"\n\"...Were I not so busy, I'd love to play with you all day, watching you dart through woods swimming in mottled sunlight, like a child of the wind, a spirit oh so carefree!...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAh, so that little Yumkasaur is named \"Jade.\" Playful, too, sounds like. Maybe you two could be friends, Little One.\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Someone's Diary:</color>\n\"...I've crossed mountains and valleys just to search for your whereabouts. If you truly wished not to see me, you could have departed...\"\n\"...But you had consideration for my pace, stopping every so often, even collecting so much Grainfruit on my behalf, not to mention those shiny stones...\"\n\"...Oh Marigold, my lovely Marigold, only I know the tender heart that lies beneath your hard shell. To be a fighter so fierce was never your intent...\"\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nErr, so Marigold's that grumpy Tepetlisaurus, then? Call Paimon blind, but she sure doesn't see how that one counts as \"tender\"!\nAnyway, back on topic. So these three Saurians are... his friends? Why'd they knock him unconscious and surround him, then?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color>\nLet's get him out first and ask questions later.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nYeah, that's true. If only we could get them to make way... Hang on, didn't the diary say that Ripple fancies Sour Sauce Kipper? There's some in camp, so maybe we can use it as a lure!\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>As for Jade... Let's send Little One to go make a friend, shall we?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nGreat idea! Jade's the fun-loving sort, so Little One just needs to lead 'er off somewhere.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>We could duel Marigold.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nErr, let's resolve this by more peaceful means, shall we? Like getting Little One to lure the fun-loving Jade away...\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Raaaawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nSee, Little One's excited about the plan too! But perhaps the simplest and least wasteful way would be to use the Sour Sauce Kipper, right?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Bring the Sour Sauce Kipper from the camp</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUse the Sour Sauce Kipper in the camp to distract Ripple!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!\nOptional Dialogue: Interact with \"Someone's Diary\" again\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(There's a diary over here...)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>(Read the first part.)</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Someone's Diary:</color>\n\"...Today's a rainy day.

Let's wait off to the side.\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Wait for a while...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHehe, looks like he was attracted by the scent of the food.\nThe gap's not large enough, though. Could you help us lure Jade away, Little One?\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr! Raaaawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNice! We'll leave it to you, then!\nLet's go check on the guy and see if he's okay once Little One leads Jade off, alright?\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Wait for your Saurian buddy to lure the Yumkasaurus away</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Negotiate with the Tepetlisaurus</color>\n<color=#ffffff>\"Marigold\":</color>\nShrawrr—!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nDon't get so worked up, we're just checking to see if the guy over there's unhurt.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Seems like it's time to duel.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nC'mon, don't give up that quickly! Look, we don't mean any harm, and we... Well, we're sure that you're not the fighty type by nature...\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>\"Oh Marigold, my lovely Marigold\"...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>\"Marigold\":</color>\nShrar! Grawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nUh oh... She's getting even angrier!\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Defeat the Tepetlisaurus</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Quest Objective:</color> <color=#ffffff>Talk to the injured person</color>\n<color=#ffffff>After being defeated, the Tepetlisaurus named \"Marigold\" drills into the ground and hides only who-knows-where. You take the chance to check on the injured person...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nNo obvious wounds... Hey, are you alright? Can you hear Paimon?\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color>\n...Hmm? Marigold? Ah, you gentle soul. You're concerned about me, aren't you? Worry not. I've been training myself to play with you without any worries...\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHey, Paimon's Paimon, y'hear? Not some Marigold! Traveler, do you think he might have hurt his head in the fall?\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>With any luck, his head will clear up soon.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>That would be a problem...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>???:</color>\nWait. You're not Marigold. What's going on? What happened to me?\n<color=#ffffff>You tell him of how he was surrounded by the three Saurians and knocked down by Marigold...</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Icayo:</color>\nAh, so that's what happened. Sorry for the trouble. The name's Icayo. As you can see, I'm an adventurer who loves chasing Saurians... and who sometimes winds up being chased by them.\nI had a spell of ill-health that resulted in my being bedridden for a while. Not only did my stamina decline greatly during that time, but I wasn't able to meet them on the regular either...\nTo have been surrounded by them even before making it to camp... Ah, how fortunate I am, to be one so fretted over.\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>You're a real positive thinker.</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Traveler:</color> <color=#ffffff>Is that how it is...?</color>\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAnyway, we had a bit of a... tussle with Marigold in our rush to save you...\n<color=#ffffff>Icayo:</color>\nAh, nothing to worry about. I imagine that was no different from any other game to her. She's probably off sulking somewhere over the loss.\nDespite appearances, she's got a delicate soul. I'll go comfort her later, so again, don't you worry.\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nAlright then. Looks like you're fine. Guess we worried for nothing, but Paimon's glad you're okay all the same.\n<color=#ffffff>Icayo:</color>\nAnd I'm grateful for that. Ah, yes. While this isn't of much value... Please, take this Sour Sauce Kipper recipe of mine, would you?\nRipple loves this dish — maybe your companion, Little One, might too!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRoooah... Rawr!\n<color=#ffffff>Paimon:</color>\nHmm? Wanna give it a try, eh? No need to worry, Traveler will make some for you!\n<color=#ffffff>Little One:</color>\nRawr!"
