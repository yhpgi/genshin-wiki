And Fried Radish Balls, as you ordered.\"\nIn Liyue, there's a place called Chihu Rock, and there stands a restaurant known as Wanmin Restaurant.\nOne must remain focused if they want to keep moving forward on the bustling streets of Liyue.\nUnsuspecting newcomers to this place are often lured away by wonderful culinary aromas or lead to peek inside stores by curious sounds.\nXiangling, who is both chef and waitress at the restaurant, delivers steaming, delicious dishes to the tables.\n\"Sit anywhere you'd like. I can make whatever you want, even if it's not on the menu!\"\nThe workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first sentence out of their mouths.\nA customer that orders without needing a menu has been at least a few times before. However, if they ask \"Is Xiangling the chef today?\" then they're definitely a regular."

Either the insides would become irreversibly charred from the heat of a Pyro Slime, or cracks would appear due to flash-freezing from a Mist Flower — or, at some step in Xiangling's unconventional cooking process, a small-scale explosion would reduce it to scrap metal. After some heavy consideration on the part of Xiangling's father, he ultimately decided not to banish his daughter from the kitchen, despite the destruction she caused.\nAs reckless, imaginative, and uninhibited as she may be, it was exactly these traits that led her to create her most successful dishes. \"Maybe this isn't so bad...\" He tried to convince himself.\nSuffice to say that payment for a new wok is a regular feature of the restaurant's monthly ledger."

That line was written on the title page.\nIf she was any other person, she would likely have regarded it as some cheesy inspirational quote. However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.\nTo her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the Li and Yue cuisines by upholding that principle.\nHowever, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception.\n\"Good food is good food, period!\"\nThe monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.\nIt was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes.\n\"I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!\""

She ate her own dishes, but nothing ever happened to her. Xiangling did feel guilty though.\nMaybe it was because she was young and healthy, or had somehow built up a resistance to certain toxins...

Halfway there, she was already tired and hungry. She stumbled into a cave, and came across a strange shrine.\nSo she sat down by the shrine, and took out two pieces of spicy cornbread.\nShe gobbled down one, but left the other one on the shrine, intending to eat a little later, but then promptly fell asleep.\nWhen she woke up, the other spicy cornbread was gone and a mysterious creature was sitting in front of her, staring.\n\"Was it good?\"\nIt nodded.\n\"More?\" She took out some jerky from her backpack.\nThe mysterious creature nodded once again.\nThis was how Xiangling made a new friend. It seemed to be drawn to Xiangling's cooking, as the creature started following Xiangling around wherever she went.\nXiangling named it \"Guoba,\" after her favorite childhood snack."

Her specialty spicy dishes earned the praise of even her father, a veteran chef with over two decades of experience.\nShe created her unique and complex flavor profile through a generous helping of chili peppers mixed with fruits and herbs for increased aroma. She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.\nSome have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes.\n\"Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight. Dry, then grind to a fine powder. Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost.\"\nThis is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.\nIn Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected."

I think lizards should just be stone-grilled in future.\"\n\"Slime fried rice is also rather ordinary. Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime jus next time.\"\nThough her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these \"special\" ingredients into delicious food.\nIn Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.\nHer Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking."

She doesn't come to the Wanmin Restaurant very often — but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time! I wouldn't have guessed she had such an appetite just by looking at her.</p>",

She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe master is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior...</p>",

The red coat glows like a stove amidst cold winds, topped with a hat that, at Hu Tao's suggestion, took inspiration from Guoba's appearance — a design that's right up Xiangling's alley.\nThe seasons turned, the days grew chill, and every store on Chihu Rock prepared for the new season.\nDown went the cooling short garments at the clothing stores, and up went the velvet-quilt coats and fur-lined dresses.\nXiangling, who had just begun putting on winter clothes, thought then that Wanmin Restaurant, too, should switch up seasonal flavors.\nCooling bean soups were out, of course, but she had yet to think of what to make for the new season.\nLogic dictates that a person's diet should match the time of year. Icy for hot weather, spicy in cold climes.\nAnd on days when hearts frigid grow like falling flakes of snow, all long for a nice hot and hearty bowl.\nWhat warms the mouth, warms the heart in turn, after all.\nAnd when one speaks of hearty warmth, a hot pot comes to mind. Yes, mutton hotpot. Why not?\nA bowl of delicious mutton soup and the company of close friends is the best way to end the year, after all.\nAnd if she could satisfy her own picky taste buds, surely the customers, too, would be pleased.\nAnd in truth, the ingredients needed for said soup were quite simple. Indeed, a friend of hers had already volunteered to buy them at her behest.\nThe difficult part was mixing the dipping sauce. This she would see to in person.\nOf course, Guoba was welcome to help if he was interested. They could have some mutton soup together later.\nThe thick sauces, readied all-year round on the stove, must first be thinned a little, then mixed in homemade shrimp oil, before being mixed with cooled boiled water.\nThe small leafy veggies she diced, before Guoba mulched them and the condiments into a paste, which she then poured into the sauce bowl alongside the fermented tofu — the latter a Wanmin secret recipe.\nBrown, green, red... Many flavors filled the bowl, together forming the warmest memory from every winter.\nAh, but not so fast — it is a Wanmin Restaurant tradition to pour on a spoonful of fried-on-the-spot Jueyun Chili oil atop the fresh seasoning mix.\nThe chilis themselves must be dried and de-seeded before boiling vegetable oil is poured onto them, and in a flash, forth pours a fragrant spiciness.\nAnd with that spoonful of chili oil, the mutton hotpot sauce is ready.\nOf course, such strong and appetizing smells are to kick up some steam — Xiangling and Guoba were barely able to stifle a simultaneous sneeze.\nOh, when was Hu Tao coming back with the meat? She could barely wait to get this hotpot started!"
