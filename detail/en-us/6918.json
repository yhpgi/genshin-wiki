Perhaps I might grant it as an exception.\"\nSo Maawe told the wise dragon the whole story of its journey,\nOf the dreams it had once cherished, and cool moonlit nights,\nOf warm shadows of red cliffs, and the songs of the Monetoo,\nOf being exiled by the matriarch, and setting out in search of elusive fury.\n\"Young one... A heart so artless, yet so audacious,\nYou come before me seeking what I too cannot obtain.\nLeave this place. You shall not find the fury you seek here.\"\nClosing its obsidian gate, the wise dragon answered Maawe no more."
