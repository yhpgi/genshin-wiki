I liked it very much.\" — Ms. Hina</p><p></p><p>[Version 2]</p><p>\"This is a rather orthodox light novel, with its contents essentially being an edited version of real life in Teyvat. What is surprising, however, is that the author seems to be highly knowledgeable about Watatsumi Island, with many vivid, almost lifelike descriptions.\" — Ms. Hina</p><p></p><p>[Version 3]</p><p>\"This light novel is based on school life and depicts the antics of all manner of schoolyard oddballs. A very entertaining read.\" — Ms. Hina</p><p></p><p>[Version 4]</p><p>\"By blending many styles together, this seemingly thin book transports you into a great many tales. I can only imagine that its author must also be a very interesting person. I happen to know someone like that, in fact — something that lends this book a very familiar touch.\" — Ms. Hina</p>",
